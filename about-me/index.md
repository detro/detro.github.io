Writing about myself has always been hard for me. It's difficult to balance between facts, without saying something too bias (it's myself after all).

**NOTE**: My opinion are _solely_ my own and do not express the view of my employer.

## Who am I?
I'm **Ivan De Marino**. I was born in [Naples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples), [Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), on the <time datetime="1982-02-06">6th of February 1982</time>.

I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scienzeinfo.unina.it/">Graduated in Computer Science</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unina.it/">"Federico II" University of Naples</a>. Since than I have working on all sort of technologies, from Mobile/Embedded Systems, to Web Development.

## Where do I live
I live in London with my lovely _wife-to-be_ Alessandra (well, unless she changes her mind :) ).

## What do I do
Well, you probably guessed it: **I code**. And [I do it in the open](http://github.com/detro) whenever I can. You can find [my _resum√©_ only on Linked In](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ivandemarino): that's the only one I can keep up to date.

I'm also starting to give talks: find [my decks here](https://speakerdeck.com/detronizator).

I also cook (lots), watch tons of movies and tv-shows (only the good ones), play videogames (when time allows it) and cycle (thanks to the support of [this guy](http://blog.ekynoxe.com/)). I also do other geeking/quirky things, like enjoying putting together IKEA furnitures (but don't tell my girlfriend, or she will order some more!).

## Contacts
Well, all the means to reach me are out there: if you can't work it out yourself, maybe we shouldn't talk at all...
