Writing about myself has always been hard for me.
It's difficult to be balanced between being honest, avoid false modesty and saying
true, genuine things about oneself.

Just remember: this is a _sort of blog_ of a Dad, and Engineer, a Geek, a Technologist,
a Neapolitan, a Cook, a Passionate individual. Passionate **AND** Opinionated.

## Who am I?
I'm **Ivan De Marino**. I was born in [Naples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples),
[Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), on the
<time datetime="1982-02-06">6th of February 1982</time>.

A bigger version of my face? <a href="http://about.me/ivandemarino" target="_blank">Here!</a>

I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scienzeinfo.unina.it/">Graduated in Computer Science</a>
at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unina.it/">"Federico II" University of Naples</a>.
Since than I have working on all sort of technologies: from Mobile/Embedded Systems,
from Web Development to Browser Testing, to large scale, massively multi-threaded systems.

_It's all about the problem that is worth solving, and the solution that is worth paying for!_

## Where do I live
After moving to the UK in 2007 and living for 8 years in **London**,
6 of which with my _then-girlfriend-now-wife_ **Alessandra**,
I have now moved to **Wokingham in Berkshire**, where my mommy and I have built
a family with **Leonardo Antonio** and **Riccardo Patrizio Lucio**.

## What do I do
I _parent_ 2 super-energetic, beautiful, intelligent boys;
I _code_ (sometimes [in the open](http://github.com/detro)), but mostly for work;
I _study_, I _watch_, I _read_, I _listen_, I _play_, I _cook_ (a lot!),
I _eat_ (too much!) but mostly I do things
with passion: **either I do it right, or I'd rather not do it at all!**
