<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6995482562605236224/">changing job</a>,
I started working on an open source project to monitor Kafka <em>consumer lag</em>.
At <a href="https://newrelic.com">New Relic</a>, a previous gig, we used <strong>a lot of Kafka</strong>,
and we cared equally about monitoring its usage: there are some
<a href="https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/new-relic-kafkapocalypse">great articles</a>
on New Relic own blogs, <a href="https://newrelic.com/blog/search?s=kafka">published over the years</a>.</p>

<p>In the process, I realised that I needed a way to spin up a Kafka cluster for
development, <em>and</em> I needed a producer of Kafka records, that was able to behave
in accordance to specific scenarios.</p>

<p>I’m also <em>still</em> learning <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, and so this was
the perfect excuse: fresh project, a language I want to become proficient in,
and time to learn-by-doing.</p>

<h2 id="ksunami-waves-of-kafka-records">Ksunami: waves of Kafka records</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://github.com/kafkesc/ksunami">GitHub</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ksunami is a command-line tool to produce a constant, configurable, cyclical
stream of (dummy) records against a Kafka Cluster Topic.</p>

  <p>If you are experimenting with scalability and latency against Kafka, and are
looking for ways to reproduce a continues stream of records, following a
specific traffic pattern that repeats periodically, Ksunami is the tool for you.</p>

  <p>Ksunami offers a way to set up the production of records, expressing the
scenario as a sequence of “phases” that repeat indefinitely.
Records content is configurable but random: the purpose of the tool is to
help with performance and scalability testing of your infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ksunami (<a href="https://crates.io/crates/ksunami">crates.io</a>)
is a command line tool, useful to reproduce typical production scenarios
that are harder to do artificially without a lot of preparation.</p>

<p>Ksunami comes from spending a few years managing Kafka infrastructure, and having
to address problems that occur in very specific, very high-throughput
situations. Situations that… <em>wake you up at night</em>.</p>

<p>In the repo I provided <a href="https://github.com/kafkesc/ksunami#examples">some ideas</a>
on how Ksunami can be used. And, even in this early stage, it already
<a href="https://github.com/kafkesc/ksunami#usage">provides many options</a>, to tailor to
very specific needs.</p>

<p>Ksunami is built around the <strong>concept of <em>4 phases</em> and <em>transitions</em></strong>: in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> I provided an extended explaination of its
<a href="https://github.com/kafkesc/ksunami#core-concepts">core concepts</a>. And if you
want to know how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Cubic_B%C3%A9zier_curves">Cubic Bézier curves</a>
fit into producing records to Kafka, give it a read.</p>

<p><strong>At the time of writing, Ksunami is at version
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/ksunami/versions"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v0.1.x</code></a></strong>, and I delineated
a bit of a roadmap in the <a href="https://github.com/kafkesc/ksunami/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Even if we are just at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.1.x</code>, Ksunami is already sporting a multi-threaded async core,
based on the superb <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a>, and a rich command line interface,
thanks to the awesome <a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap">clap</a>.</p>

<h2 id="spinning-a-kafka-cluster-for-development">Spinning a Kafka cluster for development</h2>

<p>Earlier I was hinting at
<a href="https://github.com/kafkesc/kafka-dev-cluster">Kafka Development Cluster</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <strong>battery-included</strong> BUT <strong>development-only</strong> pairing of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code> &amp;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code>, designed to quickly spin-up a Kafka cluster for
development purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kafkesc/kafka-dev-cluster"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kafka-dev-cluster</code></a> has
all someone (I?) needs to get a local dev cluster going, and it comes with some
super simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code> commands, so I can get bytes in and out of Kafka fast.</p>

<p>There is no installation: just clone the repo, and start the cluster.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/kafkesc/kafka-dev-cluster.git
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>kafka-dev-cluster
<span class="nv">$ </span>make start
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I have half a mind to add a Prometheus instance to it, so that it can spin
up a dashboard on a different port. It could help with local monitoring.
Ah, and maybe a <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html#sr-overview">Schema Registry</a>?</p>

<h2 id="wait-whats-githubcomkafkesc">“Wait! What’s github.com/kafkesc?”</h2>

<p>I created an dedicated GitHub Organization to host what I’m doing.
Yes! It <em>was</em> supposed to be called <em>Kafkesque</em>, but someone decide to take
that username, and use it to make 2 commits in 5 years ;-(.
So I went for a funny alternative: <a href="https://github.com/kafkesc">Kafkesc</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115027432?s=400&amp;u=cdabaa31af9824aaaeb05edb8f1c808f10ad1027&amp;v=4" alt="Kafkesc" /></p>

<p>In this organization I’m going to host Kafka-related repositories
and projects, as the needs arise.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<p>Ksunami is a <em>Records Producer</em>: I can tell it to produce more or less,
at specific intervals, with specific spikes and valleys,
tailoring its behaviour to the scenarios I want.</p>

<p>I now need a <em>Records Consumer</em>! Something that can be made to misbehave?
That every 10 minutes takes a <em>nap</em> and stops consuming? That turns on
once a day, consumes a whole topic of records, and then sleeps for 23h,
letting records (and lag) accumulate?</p>

<p>Sorry, it will be a while before I can release a consumer lag calculator. But I
did write last year a Rust parser for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__consumer_offsets</code>: maybe I should
take a second and release that as a Rust Crate?</p>]]></content><author><name>Ivan De Marino</name></author><category term="ksunami" /><category term="kafkesc" /><category term="apache" /><category term="kafka" /><category term="opensource" /><category term="project" /><category term="workload" /><category term="producer" /><category term="records" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[October this year, while I was in the process of changing job, I started working on an open source project to monitor Kafka consumer lag.

<p>A new Terraform provider is available, designed to interact with ZooKeeper ZNodes:
<a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest">TFZK</a>.
The latest stable version is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1.0.3</code>, and you should give it a go.</p>

<p>Ah! And <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest/docs">here is the doc</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ok-i-got-more-time---go-ahead">OK, I got more time - go ahead!</h2>

<p>Earlier this year I decided to scratch a long-standing itch: build a
<a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers">Terraform Provider</a>
for <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">Apache ZooKeeper</a>. While there was already
<a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ContentSquare/zookeeper/latest">one</a>,
it came with limitations that created issues in production environments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only supported connecting to a <em>single</em> ensemble member</li>
  <li>no support for storing binary data</li>
  <li>no access to the <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkStatStructure">ZNode Stat Structure</a></li>
  <li>no support for <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Sequence+Nodes+--+Unique+Naming"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PERSISTENT_SEQUENTIAL</code> ZNodes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Enter <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest">Terraform Provider ZooKeeper (TFZK)</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/tfzk/terraform-provider-zookeeper">GitHub repo</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/img/tfzk-logo.png" alt="tfzk logo" /></p>

<h2 id="wait-whats-zookeeper">Wait! What’s ZooKeeper?</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/index.html">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications.
It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management,
synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don’t have
to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus,
group management, leader election, and presence protocols.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-does-zookeeper-have-to-do-with-terraform">What does ZooKeeper have to do with Terraform?</h2>

<p>Good question.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro">Terraform</a> is a <em>de-facto</em>
industry standard for managing small, medium and even large infrastructure in a
declarative manner. In a <em>cloud world</em>, <strong>Terraform is a tool to bring order to chaos</strong>.</p>

<p>Build a large enough infrastructure, and you will need to come up with ways to
dynamically distribute configuration to running systems. Say, you need a way
to inform your 
<em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/sharding">sharded</a> cloud infrastructure</em>
of things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>which shard is in charge of what incoming traffic</li>
  <li>how services running in one shard, can send data to another one</li>
  <li>a new shard was deployed</li>
  <li>an existing shard was retired/drained</li>
</ul>

<p>You could, in theory, provide your <em>topology</em> to every service, via startup-time configuration.
But that comes with a non-zero downtime: you need to modify and distribute the
configuration, and then restart your services to read it. Not ideal for your uptime.</p>

<p>That’s where a service like ZooKeeper shines: it’s not designed for
high throughput or for storing lots of data. But to be a reliable central place
to send services to, so they can coordinate and react to larger infrastructure changes.</p>

<p>So, to answer your question, <em>what does ZooKeeper have to do with Terraform?</em>
ZooKeeper can be a perfect place to store a <em>live</em> picture of your
infrastructure reality and let services rely on it to listen for changes.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-can-i-do-with-this-provider">So, what can I do with this provider?</h2>

<p>ZooKeeper can do a lot of things, but all are built around the core concept
of <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkDataModel_znodes">ZNode</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every node in a ZooKeeper tree is referred to as a znode.
Znodes maintain a stat structure that includes version numbers for data changes,
acl changes. The stat structure also has timestamps.
The version number, together with the timestamp, allows ZooKeeper to validate
the cache and coordinate updates.
Each time a znode’s data changes, the version number increases.
For instance, whenever a client retrieves data, it also receives the version of the data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TFZK offers a ZNode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Persistent ZNodes resource: <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest/docs/resources/znode"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zookeeper_znode</code></a></li>
  <li>A Persistent Sequential ZNodes resource: <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest/docs/resources/sequential_znode"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zookeeper_sequential_znode</code></a></li>
  <li>A ZNode data source: <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest/docs/data-sources/znode"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zookeeper_znode</code></a></li>
  <li>Support for <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest/docs#servers">connecting the provider to all servers</a> in the Ensemble</li>
  <li>Configurable <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest/docs#zookeeper-sessions">sessions time-out</a></li>
  <li>Full access to the ZNodes <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest/docs#the-stat-structure">Stat Structure</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Given that a Terraform Provider only “runs” during your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plan</code>s and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apply</code>s,
its focus is on Persistent ZNodes. For this reason, it can’t support 
Ephemeral ZNodes, Watchers and other “live” features, that are built
for services that hold a persistent connection:
those are more targeted at runtime services and applications (i.e. your code).</p>

<h2 id="ok-im-sold-how-do-i-get-started">OK, I’m sold. How do I get started?</h2>

<p>At the time I’m writing this, <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/1.0.3"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1.0.3</code></a>
is out. Start by adding to your Terraform configuration:</p>

<div class="language-terraform highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">terraform</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">required_providers</span> <span class="p">{</span>

      <span class="nx">source</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">"tfzk/zookeeper"</span>
      <span class="nx">version</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">"1.0.3"</span>

<span class="k">provider</span> <span class="s2">"zookeeper"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1"># Configuration options</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then head to the
<a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tfzk/zookeeper/latest/docs">official documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="its-great-but-its-missing-feature-x">It’s great, but it’s missing feature X!</h2>

<p>Great, <a href="https://github.com/tfzk/terraform-provider-zookeeper#development">why don’t you help me?</a>

can spin up an ensemble to test against.</p>

<p>We all know that UK is very much London centered, and this is reflected in the
graph above. The government doesn’t shy away from policy that are openly “pro-London”
and while there are complaints, as an immigrant since 2007, I can see not much
more than some “grumpiness” about it. It’s like Britons are <em>“sort of ok with it”</em>.</p>

<h2 id="enter-help-to-buy-scheme">Enter “Help to Buy” scheme</h2>

<p>To address the housing needs, the Tory government has come up with <a href="http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/">Help to Buy</a>: you put 5% deposit (say £10k), the government puts 20% (say £40k) and you can now afford a home of up to £200k - you can easily find a bank that would give you
a Mortgage for <strong>75% LTV</strong>. It’s like asking them for a glass of water: of course
they will have you as a customer.</p>

<p>This sounds great, but it’s actually a recipe for disaster.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-buy-any-kind-of-home-with-the-htb-scheme">Can I buy any kind of home with the HTB scheme?</h2>

<p>HTB has been launched in 2 phases in 2013: <strong>HTB1</strong> (<em>Equity Loan</em>) and <strong>HTB2</strong> (<em>Mortgage Guarantees</em>) first only applied for newly built homes,
now HTB can be used also to purchase pre-built homes. But ONLY in the formula HTB2:
instead of giving you 20% of the money, the HTB2 just makes the government guarantor
of your Mortgage.</p>

<p>All of those, capped to £600k.</p>

<p>Sounds good, right?
Not a bit. But first let’s highlight the benefit.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-everyone-is-buying-so-much-if-htb-is-so-bad">So, why everyone is buying so much if HTB is so bad?</h2>

<p>Because we are stupid. Humans rarely think long term.
All of a sudden, Bob (fictional character) can afford a much bigger house, and he
has to only provide 5% of deposit. Suddenly, life is amazing.</p>

<p>HTB works as a loan: once you buy, you are repaying the government a monthly installment
(to define with a HMRC official). First 5 years are interest free (WOW!) and then
it’s like 1.5% + some increase over time. It’s a great loan compared to any Mortgage.</p>

<p>If prices of houses were fair, this would be a great thing that would really
allow people to buy a home.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-their-means">Beyond their means</h2>

<p>In short, people are buying beyond their means.
Yes, you have taken 20% of the money with this great cheap loan, so in theory you
are saving loads of money. But still, you now have 2 loans: a Mortgage and the HTB loan.
Your credit score is affected. You are less “trust worthy” in case you need an emergency
loan.</p>

<p>And if that 5% deposit was already hard to put together, you are most certainly now
in a situation where ALL your income is taken by the repayments.
You can make it, but just a glitch in your monthly INs/OUTs and you are in trouble.</p>

<p>I have made my calculation, so it’s possible to take the HTB and still be comfortably
between your means. But as a Software Engineer, my income is way above the national
average: I ought to be in this position.</p>

<h2 id="builders-are-getting-richer-at-tax-payers-expenses">Builders are getting richer, at tax-payers expenses</h2>

<p>If house prices where a fixed value, this whole HTB thing would be great and Britain
would have no housing problems.</p>

<p>But the market laws are well known: flood the market with money, and prices will soar.
And that’s what’s happening. House prices are going drastically up because more people
can afford them all of a sudden.</p>

<p>That would be “OK” if there wasn’t a party exploiting this.</p>

<p>What we forget to consider, is that Government’s Money is OUR money. Is what every
month we pay in taxes. Is the the 20/30/40/50% of our monthly sweat that goes “puff”
so that the <em>“Government Machine can keep cranking”</em>. Mind you, I’m not complaining
about this: this is what a government does - takes money from X to make Y happen.
It’s sort-of an investment logic at play, on a country-scale.</p>

<p>The issue I have is that the HTB is being exploited BIG TIME by big house builders
(i.e. not your average tiny builder - we are talking about market-floating companies like
<a href="http://www.bewley.co.uk/">Bewley Homes</a>, <a href="http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/">Barrat / David Wilson</a>, <a href="https://bloorhomes.com/">Bloor Homes</a>, <a href="https://www.crestnicholson.com/">Crest Nicholson</a>…)
to squeeze as much money as possible out of buyers and government’s pocket. That
at the end of the day are the same pocket!</p>

<p>And how they do that? How they maximise their profit? <strong>Withholding properties!</strong></p>

<p>Try to go to any site where they have set up a show-room and they are starting
to sell the first plots. They will tell you that “only this much are available right now”.
You will ask “what’s going to be available in X months?”. They will show you what
but prices will not be available because, in X months, the very same house, built 50
meters down the same road, might be able to go on the market for £10/20k extra!</p>

<p>New homes increase the market-demand for homes. Even pre-owned. This is basic
economics that any university student has studied at some point. It’s called
“Fabricated Demand”. You go down the street, and see signage of “New Luxury Homes” in
your neighbourhood. Your mind now wants to buy, but the new homes are too costly.
So you buy something else.</p>

<p>The houses on the market reduce in number, so what’s left can ask for more money.
The builder knows that the customer can use HTB to “spend that little extra for their
dream home”. So they are ready to release houses at the right time. At a price that
maximise profit.</p>

<p>To prove that, check the price of homes that are above the HTB £600k threshold:
because HTB doesn’t apply to them, their prices can’t move as much. They incur the
risk of going “out of market”.</p>

<h2 id="whats-different-from-the-usual-market-rules">What’s different from the usual “market rules”</h2>

<p>What’s different is that the HTB has injected money that have altered reality.
More money means pushing prices beyond the “too expensive” point. The point that
houses were supposed to reach, before demand will cease and sellers would be forced
to rethink their pricing.</p>

<p>Ah, and consider also that UK has done massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">Quantitative Easing (QE)</a>: pretty much printing money.
This is where the Government gets the extra-edge to support HTB.</p>

<p>But QE is a dangerous thing to over-use: ultimately those extra money in the market
will be paid by the tax-payers, through massively inflated prices (i.e. <em>inflation baby!</em>).</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-once-you-cant-repay-your-mortgage">What happens once you can’t repay your Mortgage?</h2>

<p><strong>Who cares! The builder is happy!</strong> Who is in trouble is the customer (that can’t
repay the mortgage and loses his/her home) and the Government (that has lost
tax-payers money).</p>

<p>In this game, the loser is always you.
Unless you are a builder: in that case your third yacht is coming next week.</p>

<p><strong>I’d call this ++a new house bubble++.</strong> But in a country where media are very much influenced by
government, mentioning bubble would probably get journalists fired…</p>]]></content><author><name>Ivan De Marino</name></author><category term="help to buy" /><category term="uk" /><category term="politics" /><category term="affordable" /><category term="housing" /><category term="bubble" /><category term="pricing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Britain, you have a problem: house prices in the East/South East have grown ridiculous.

So he decides to go
out for a wander. The pressure was too much. He knew that, sooner or later,

<p>To cool off, he decides to go up there. On that peak no one will follow him.
They were all pretty much exhausted: no sane mind would follow him in a hike at
this stage. Good, that would do!</p>

<p>Also, on top of that no stupid idiot would yell at him how stupid was to leave
the stupid Egyptians. Yes, slavery was bad, and building palaces, pyramids and
the sort was getting boring, but they got something to eat there. A shelter.
A mean to survive.</p>

<p>When he is about to reach the top of the mountain, from far, he sees something
“sparkly”. A big metal box, looking like made of gold, but was too far to
distinguish it’s details. So, he decided to look into it.</p>

    <span>"THE" Phonebooth</span>

<p>Unbelievable! It was a… phonebooth. No keypad on it: just one button.
On the button and engraved on it: <strong>“Mr God”</strong>.</p>

<p>He picks the phone, pushes the button and waits…</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Heaven.</p>

<p>(Phone ringing)</p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Mmm…</em></p>

<p>(Phone still ringing)</p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Oh crap! Another idiot calling from Sinai. I don’t have time for this shit today!</em></p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>God, do you want me to take that?</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Yes, please. Tell him to fuck off.</em></p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>OK!</em></p>

<p>Secretary (whispering)&gt; <em>Such a tool…</em></p>

<p>(Secretary answers the phone)</p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>Heeeelllo!</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>Hi. Is this God?</em></p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>Actually, I’m his secretary. Farrokh.</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>Farrokh?</em></p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>Yes, Farrokh. Farrokh Bulsara.</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>You are a man! I would assumed God’s secretary to be a hot girl</em></p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>You haven’t seen me, my dear!</em></p>

<p>(Awkward silence)</p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>So, how can I help?</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>May I speak with Mr God, please.</em></p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>God is quite busy at the moment. He is working on his latest play: “Landing in America”.</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>Mmm… OK. Whatever. Can I speak with him?</em></p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>He is actually very busy. He hates being interrupted when he is testing new religious scenarios.</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>It will only take a minute!</em></p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>Mmm… wait please.</em></p>

<p>(Secretary puts his hand on the phone and starts whispering to God)</p>

<p>Secretary&gt; <em>He insists. He sounds quite like a rude guy. Do you want me to put him through?</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>FUCK!!! I’m never gonna finish this shit if I get interrupted all the time!</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>OK. Let the fucker through. But fucking cut the line if I’m not done in 2 minutes.
Those South Americans can’t be kept waiting. They already started building all
sort of crazy shit to substitute me and I got to crash that pretty soon…</em></p>

<p>(God coughs and deepens his voice)</p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Hello child!</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>Hello God. How have you been?</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Moses! It’s been a while. Did you like the water trick?</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>Impressive. For a second I thought you won’t be paying attention and I’d
have looked like a tool, standing there with my harms in the air, and nothing
actually happening.</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Glad to be helpful.</em></p>

<p>(God picking his nose while talking)</p>

<p>God&gt; <em>OK. It was nice to speak with you. I shall…</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>Wait. I called to ask for your help. Those people down there, they are driving me crazy!</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>One of them just started melting gold and he wants to make a cow! Or a Lamb, I don’t know.</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Yes, I have seen it - I won’t worry too much. You will probably be all dead pretty soon…</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>But they want to worship it!!!</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Stupid dick-heads! That’s why I’m giving up on y’all!</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>“Y’all”!?!?!</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Yeah. I started to pick up some of that American slang you know…</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>No please. I need your help! Don’t you have an advice or a message I could bring to them?</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Shit. I’m tired. It has been a long day. Can’t you call again tomorrow?</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>Come on! You are usually so patronising? For once that I’m actually asking for it?</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Mmmm… OK. Have you got a pen?</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>No. Left it in the other trousers. I got a couple of stone slabs though…</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>That would do!</em></p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>OK. Go ahead!</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>First Commandment: <strong>NEVER CALL GOD IN VANE!</strong>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>Oh. OK. That’s it?</em></p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Of course not, fuck face. Here is number Two.</em></p>

<p>(Click. Phone disconnects.)</p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>God? GOD? Holy shit, this guy! He is impossible.</em></p>

<p>(Moses thinks a bit and then says…)</p>

<p>Moses&gt; <em>Well, once again, I suppose I’ll have to just make stuff up.</em></p>

<p>(Meanwhile)</p>

<p>God&gt; <em>Moses? MOSES? Whatever…</em></p>

should probably go and <a href="http://phantomjs.org/download.html">download it</a>.
It contains <a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.1.0">GhostDriver 1.1.0 “Banquo”</a>,
and that’s it.</p>

<p>1.9.6, released not more than 2 weeks ago (1 week?), was a <em>coordination went wrong</em>
and I take part of the responsibility for it. Just discard that release.</p>

<h1 id="whats-the-long-story">What’s the long story?</h1>
<p>So, for a few days I was helping with testing and refining the
<a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/pull/11535">new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cookiejar</code> module (#11535)</a>
for PhantomJS that <a href="https://github.com/jtrollinson">Joseph Rollinson (jtrollinson)</a>
contributed.
I’m very interested in this module because it allows to instantiate <strong>multiple
Cookie Jar objects</strong> instead of having all the WebPage object use the same jar.
Such feature would allow GhostDriver to finally support
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/issues/170">Session Isolation (#170)</a>, a long
overdue feature.</p>

<p><a href="https://ivandemarino.me/2014/01/ghostdriver-1-1-0-codename-banquo/">I had just released GhostDriver 1.1.0</a>,
and so I was pretty much all setup to do an extra release.
Having that feature supported would make PhantomJS/GhostDriver play better with
Selenium Grid, allowing to register more than 1 session against one browser
process instance.</p>

<p>So, once the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cookijar</code> thing was merged, I cut
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.1.1">GhostDriver 1.1.1 “Okiku”</a>
and promptly made
<a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/pull/11893">a PR against PhantomJS to merge that in</a>.</p>

<p><a href="github.com/ariya">Ariya</a> was so kind to wait for me to do that and cut a <strong>minor</strong> release of
PhantomJS: in his intention <em>just bugfixes and latest GhostDriver</em>.
Little he knew that latest GhostDriver depended on the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cookiejar</code> feature.</p>

<p>So, when he prepared the release branch (by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git cherry-pick</code>-ing), left out
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cookiejar</code> module, but included GhostDriver 1.1.1.</p>

<p>Result? KA-BOOM!</p>

<div class="img">
    <img src="http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/KA-BOOM-1.jpg" alt="KA-BOOM!" />
</div>

<h1 id="lesson-learned">Lesson Learned</h1>
<p>Next time I decide to add support to a major feature (even if it’s not in my
direct project but the one I’m based upon), I should increase the
<strong>minor version number</strong> or even the <strong>major</strong> (depending on the case).</p>

<p>If I had done that, Ariya would have known that
<em>it wasn’t just a minor fix in GhostDriver</em>,
and this mess would have been avoided.</p>

Last time I have cut a release of GhostDriver
(<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.0.4">1.0.4</a>)
was… July 2013.
And <a href="https://ivandemarino.me/2013/08/10/GhostDriver-1-0-4-blog-migration-and-blogging-too-little/">blogged about it</a>
only in August!!!
I gotta take a look at my GitHub commits over the 2013: something tells me that
<em>year-in-commits</em> nicely overlaps with my eventful 2013.
But let’s try to stay on topic.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.1.0">GhostDriver 1.1.0</a>,
codename <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banquo">“Banquo”</a></em>.
This time the codename was picked by my wife - fitting, given how important she
has become this year for Leonardo and Me.</p>

<p>I know, I keep going off topic. Sorry…</p>

<p>As I’m writing, this new version hasn’t been imported into PhantomJS yet,
but it will be very soon. Definitely before next release of PhantomJS. And please,
don’t ask me about that - there is the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/phantomjs">PhantomJS Google Group</a>
for this kind of questions (I have
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phantomjs/ouFiiB1UoLw">just opened a discussion</a>
about this).</p>

<h1 id="whats-new-in-110">What’s new in 1.1.0</h1>

<p>For a complete, up-to-date list of changes in the releases of
GhostDriver, please DO take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHANGELOG</code></a>.</p>

<p>Here is a <em>cut&amp;paste</em> for 1.1.0:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ENHANCEMENT #293: Import Selenium 2.39.0 WebDriver Atoms</li>
  <li>ENHANCEMENT: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/maximize</code> window will set the window size to 1336x768,
currently most common resolution online (see <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#resolution-ww-monthly-201307-201312">statcounter</a>)</li>
  <li>ENHANCEMENT #275: <strong>Implemented Browser and Network (HAR) Logging types</strong></li>
  <li>FIXED #284: Attempt to wait for Page to Load if input causes form submit</li>
  <li>FIXED #291: Throw exception when attempting to set invalid timeout value</li>
  <li>FIXED #259: Fix issue regarding mouse clicks</li>
  <li>ENHANCEMENT #290: Enabled support for “Keep Alive” HTTP connections</li>
  <li>ENHANCEMENT #262: <strong>Allow access to PhantomJS API from WebDriver (Driver part)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As you might have noticed, I have highlighted 2 entries above…</p>

<h2 id="browser-and-network-har-logging">Browser and Network (HAR) Logging</h2>

<p>One <em>difficulty</em> of working with an headless browser is: there is no
direct way to look at the browser and try to understand what it’s doing. It’s
pretty much a black-box and debugging your tests against it might be hard.</p>

<p>Logging was already implemented, but the only way to grab the output was via
<strong>standard output/error redirect</strong>. Not always suitable for the client-server
architecture of WebDriver.</p>

<p>The WebDriver WireProtocol defines a
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/log">set of API to access LOGs</a>
of different type.
The <em>logtype</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">client</code> is implemented by the binding. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">driver</code> should
provide a view into the <em>inner guts</em> of the WebDriver implementation. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">browser</code> essentially is the <em>console</em> of the browser. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server</code>… I’m
not sure.
In GhostDriver 1.1.0 we have added support for 2: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">browser</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">har</code>.</p>

<p><em>HAR???</em> Yes, <a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/">HAR - HTTP Archive</a>.
While I explained already the browser log-type, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">har</code> will return a single-entry
log, with the HAR of the current webpage, since the first load (it’s cleared
at every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unload</code> event).</p>

<p>Support for the other logtypes might come in the future (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">driver</code> type should
be simple enough).</p>

<p>A great <strong>THANK YOU</strong> goes to <a href="https://github.com/torinaki">Dmitry Balabka (torinaki)</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/wgroeneveld">Wouter Groeneveld (wgroeneveld)</a> for their
key contributions. <em>Keep it coming guys!</em></p>

<h2 id="access-to-phantomjs-api">Access to PhantomJS API</h2>

<p>This feature that has been requested SO MANY FREAKING TIMES!!!</p>

<p>PhantomJS has <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/API-Reference">a rich set of API</a>
to control and tune the internal WebKit core.
Access to the plethora of API that PhantomJS has was always high, since the
beginning of the GhostDriver project.</p>

<p>While some see GhostDriver/PhantomJS as <em>just</em> a WebDriver implementation against
a non-production browser, others see this as a way to easily control PhantomJS
from another software.
The issue was that the WebDriver Protocol is <em>tuned</em> for a specific scenario: emulate
user interaction with a browser. PhantomJS is a bit less of a browser, and more
of a <strong>scriptable browser engine</strong>. And it’s very useful in scenarios also not
strictly related to testing and user interaction.</p>

<p>This API allows to send a string of JavaScript, written for PhantomJS, and be
interpreted within the context of a WebDriver Page. In other words, for the given
script the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this</code> variable is initialized to be the current Page.</p>

<p>The format of this <em>WebDriver Protocol Extension</em>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP POST /session/:id/phantom/execute
{
    "script"    : SCRIPT_SCRIPT
    "args"      : [ARRAY_OF_JS_BASIC_TYPES]
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To see an example use of this API, check out
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/blob/master/test/java/src/test/java/ghostdriver/PhantomJSCommandTest.java">this example</a>.</p>

<p>This new API was <strong>entirely developed</strong> by
<a href="https://github.com/watsonmw">Mark Watson (watsonmw)</a>,
ex-colleague of mine at
<a href="https://ivandemarino.me/2011/12/14/Crossing-the-pond/">Neustar</a>
and awesome chap.</p>

<h1 id="what-do-i-have-left-to-do">What do I have left to do</h1>

<p>As I write this, I still have to finish up a couple of tasks to consider 1.1.0
fully released:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del>Commit 1.1.0 Java Bindings’s JAR to the Selenium repository</del>
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=6146f3a5bec6bd28747e91a07cacd75a3db589f2">DONE</a></li>
  <li><del>Import 1.1.0 into PhantomJS</del>
<a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/pull/11877">DONE</a></li>
  <li><del>Tag 1.1.0 on the repository</del>
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.1.0">DONE</a></li>
</ul>

A night just like this one. Winter. Everyone in the house
was asleep. Well, Leonardo isn’t really sleeping right now but you get the idea.
I was alone in the kitchen. Alone with the TV, an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.avi</code> file and an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.srt</code> file.</p>

<p>I had just started watching movies in foreign language and during the week I had
stumbled upon <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/">Old Boy</a>.
I wasn’t really in the mode of staying up late, but something made me.</p>

<div class="img">
    <img src="/img/oldboy-poster.jpg" alt="Oldboy (2003)" />
    <span>Oldboy (Korean poster)</span>
</div>

<p>The title was in English: how was I supposed to know it was a movie from
South Korea? I know, I was <em>very naïve</em>.</p>

<p>I remember being captured very quickly by the story. It was intriguing, cruel,
nightmare-ish. Just the kind of stuff that tingles me. The main actor,
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158856/">Min-sik Choi</a>,
looked a lot like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329/">Jackie Chan</a>,
but much better at acting.</p>

<p>I just finished watching it again. Now I got a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.mkv</code>, and the subtitles are a
track in it, but the greatness of this movie comes back to mind.</p>

<p><strong>Luckly I had almost entirely forgotten the story, so I have enjoyed it all over
again</strong>. But it’s funny: 10 years later you see new details - you notice new scenes,
new details you had missed, new characters even. I had totally forgot about the
way he gets released and the first guy with the dog that
he meets once he is back in the world.</p>

<p>Same exact movie: what is changed is me. In 10 years SO MUCH has changed.
10 years ago I had not met yet my lovely wife. I knew I wanted to leave the
limiting life of the south of Italy, but I didn’t know I could actually do it.
I didn’t know that the next time me and this movie would meet,
I’d be living a completely new life.
With a beautiful wife and a beautiful son - my own little family that
is just starting.</p>

<p>Every New Year’s Eve I look back at the year, make a mental list of what changed,
<em>“where am I now”</em>. I enjoy thinking that, next year, I’ll be somewhere else
again with my life. <em>How exciting!</em></p>

<p>Maybe in 10 years, 2023, I should find again this long lost friend of a movie,
and watch it again. What the hell! I will definitely do that. Let’s just hope
I don’t change too much and forget to do it.</p>

<p>Maybe in 10 years, my son will join me. Well, he will be 10 and this movie
will be probably too <em>“gruesome”</em> for him - let’s say he will have to wait 20
years instead…</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong>. You bastard. How do you go so fast?</p>

<h1 id="ps">P.S.</h1>

<p>Yes, I know that
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321511/">Spike Lee’s “new” Oldboy</a>
has just been released, but that’s an almost total coincidence.
I’m going to eventually watch this <em>USA edition</em>, but I don’t expect it to make
me happy - remakes are usually badly executed.
Still, the actors involved are very good so I don’t expect to be disappointed either.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ivan De Marino</name></author><category term="oldboy" /><category term="movie" /><category term="south korea" /><category term="personal" /><category term="growth" /><category term="life" /><category term="change" /><category term="italy" /><category term="uk" /><category term="night" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was 10 years ago.

But finally, “normality” seems not too far
away.</p>

<p>Many things have happened in the recent months: we got <strong>married</strong>; I helped my
lovely wife with the <strong>pregnancy</strong> (well, she did all the hard work); and, on the
7th of November, we have became parents of this <strong>beauty</strong>:</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="/img/leo.png" alt="Leonardo Antonio DE MARINO-SIMOLA" />
<span>Leonardo Antonio DE MARINO-SIMOLA</span>
</div>

<p>Now, we have to slowly learn to live our new life <strong>together</strong>: while we learn
how to be parents, Leonardo will be learning how to be a baby. What now looks
like a difficult, consuming and intense task (ask me how much we sleep
at night!), will at some point become “daily routine”.
<em>A sweeter routine with Leo at the center of it all!</em></p>

<p>It is a full <strong>RESET</strong> to which we need to <strong>SETTLE</strong>. A <strong>RESETTLE</strong>.</p>

<p>A new life,
with many unknowns to uncover, but also the will and need to be as united and as
strong - actually, even more. But love seems to be our great strength, and
Alessandra and I are quite good at <em>teamwork</em>.</p>

<h1 id="night-sleep-a-memory-of-the-past">Night sleep: a memory of the past</h1>

<p>Well, as EVERYONE warned us, sleeping with a newborn baby is like trying to play
retro videogames: you ALWAYS want to do, but never manage to.</p>

<p>Leonardo is a very unstable sleeper so far, and he seems to like to be more
active during the night: maybe a good skill if he decides to join me in the
<em>craft of programming</em>, but for now it’s just an energy drain (for us!).
A drain that transforms into a sweet smile once you see his eyes looking at you.
You are tired, you are exhausted but, somehow, his puffy cheeks make
everything perfect.</p>

<p>One thing that seems to work is carrying him around, while I rock him and tell
him all sort of <em>stuff</em>, just from the top of my head.
I think I have already talked him into becoming a software developer: he hasn’t
disagreed, so I assume he is OK with it :-P .</p>

<h1 id="time-for-ourselves">Time for ourselves?</h1>

<p>This is close to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> for now. Either as a couple, or on our own, time to do
stuff by yourself seems a very hard thing to achieve. But I’m sure it will get
better: myself I’m still a night-worker, so with his sleeping becoming more
regular, working a bit on <strong>opensource</strong> or playing videogames will be
eventually possible.</p>

<h2 id="blog-migration-finished">Blog migration finished!</h2>

<p>Talking of having no time to do stuff, while it seemed quite impossible,
I have indeed managed to complete
the blog migration! It took a while to do
the different bits, and I still have stuff to work on, but I’m now serving this
from <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate the static HTML/CSS/JS.
Much happier: I can move to any other hosting in a matter of hours. I don’t
even know why I was bothering to use non-static content for
blogging/personal site.</p>

<p>If interested, the repository with all the source code (posts +
Jekyll plugins) can be found at my
<a href="https://github.com/detro/detro.github.io/tree/source">detro/detro.github.io “source” branch</a>.</p>

<h1 id="resume-blogging">Resume blogging</h1>

<p>Migrating the blog means also producing more content, right?
Well, this is a first attempt. Not a great one, I admit -
I find quite difficult to come up with things to say, when my brain it’s
affected by sleep deprivation.
But I have a TODO list on my whiteboard of things I want to talk about:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bought and still setting up a <a href="http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html?oid=5336624#!tab=features">N54L</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> NAS at home: I think some of the
decisions I have taken so far in the configuration process are worth sharing</li>
  <li>An update on the status of the
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver">GhostDriver</a> and
<a href="http://phantomjs.org">PhantomJS</a> projects</li>
  <li>A satiric bible-related story that I want to publish (very short and
quite offensive :P)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/detro/sulfur">Sulfur</a>, that I haven’t introduced
nor documented properly <em>yet</em>: it’s a tiny Java library that provides a level
of abstraction over <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a></li>
  <li>2013 is the year I read the most in my life:
<a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/">George R.R. Martin</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>
<em>in primis</em></li>
  <li>I’m leaving <a href="http://www.amazondcl.com/">Amazon AIV ADCL</a></li>
  <li>Algorithms that I have re-studied and coded examples of</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="catching-up-on-personal-projects">Catching up on personal projects</h1>

<p>I have been quite far from <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver">GhostDriver</a> and
<a href="http://phantomjs.org">PhantomJS</a>. Partially is my fault (I did spend some time
playing <em>GTA V</em> before Leonardo was here), but mostly is because of all the
above.</p>

<p>While I don’t really have a fully up-to-date picture of what’s happening with
PhantomJS, I know that
<a href="https://github.com/Vitallium/phantomjs-qt5">Vitallium is working on the porting to Qt5</a>.
That is a very exciting perspective, and the project looks like it has a
brilliant future ahead.</p>

<p>Also, the <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt-Project</a> is
<a href="http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2013/06/25/experimenting-with-chromium-and-qt/">moving Chromium/Blink</a>:
this means that PhantomJS architecture will have to change sensibly, the core
will be based on a more <em>commercial</em> browser and, most importantly, I believe
a full API compatibility break would be a given. <em>Why is that good?</em> Because
we could apply all we learned from developing PhantomJS so far, and do a better
job in many areas.</p>

<h2 id="quick-note-about-ghostdriver">Quick note about GhostDriver</h2>

<p>GhostDriver has received some love (aka <em>Pull Requests</em>). I have worked to
integrate them into an upcoming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.1.0</code>, but I think there are other more
pressing improvements to do, before considering a release.</p>

<p>And, if you really want to, you can still check out the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch
and run it inside latest PhantomJS. So, I don’t feel too much pressure to
package a full release.</p>

<p><em>That’s all for now.</em></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I still haven’t told you what’s my next job, have I? :)</p>]]></content><author><name>Ivan De Marino</name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="leonardo" /><category term="life" /><category term="reset" /><category term="settling" /><category term="blogging" /><category term="opensource" /><category term="ghostdriver" /><category term="phantomjs" /><category term="job" /><category term="career" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puff, Pant!

Yes, it’s a shame that the world can’t read my terrible English on a more regular basis.
Yes, I’m lazy.</p>

<p>Well, here is a quick update for the few eager souls I have let down.</p>

<h3 id="ghostdriver">GhostDriver</h3>

<p>I have release <a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.0.4">GhostDriver 1.0.4 - “Arghan Div”</a>. It should be released in the <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11452">upcoming PhantomJS 1.9.2</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="http://placehold.it/600x150/eee/500&amp;text=1.0.4" />
</div>

<p>The code has been merged already into <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/commit/73bb56084028e1ee902bfedb8bd0443b337c7578">PhantomJS master branch</a> so, if you are really keen on putting your hands on it, just do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./build.sh</code> of that branch.</p>

<h3 id="blog-migration">Blog migration</h3>

<p>I’m planning to abandon <a href="https://github.com/detro/bloggart">my fork of Bloggart</a>. I have written a “backupper” that uses Node.JS to download and save locally all the Pages and Posts stored in it. If you use Bloggart and want to “leave” as well, look in <a href="https://github.com/detro/bloggart/tree/blogivandemarinome-configuration/backup">here</a>.</p>

<p>I want to move to a static generated, file stored blog. I initially thought about building it myself, but then I realised I have no time so I’m going to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. First tests look promising. I hope I’ll get around to do it. And I want to use GitHub Pages to host it.</p>

<p>I’ll probably have to make sure URLs are redirected properly, as I don’t know how much of my current hostname structure I can use on GitHub pages.</p>

<h3 id="blogging-too-little">Blogging too little</h3>

<p>One reason to migrate is that I think I’ll write more if I can dump my thoughts into text file and do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code>: loading a URL to the Admin interface of this blog and typing in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">textarea</code> is sort of difficult nowdays.</p>

<p>So that might make me blog more. Or not. I don’t know. Will see.</p>
