                <p>Britain, you have a problem: house prices in the East/South East have grown
ridiculous. See
<a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/house-price-index/april-2014/info-hpi-comparison.html">2014 house pricing data by the Office for National Statistics (ONS)</a> that compares prices
with the pre-crisis ones.</p>

    <span>+31.6!?!?!?!</span>
</div>

<p>We all know that UK is very much London centered, and this is reflected in the
graph above. The government doesn&#39;t shy away from policy that are openly &quot;pro-London&quot;
and while there are complaints, as an immigrant since 2007, I can see not much
more than some &quot;grumpiness&quot; about it. It&#39;s like Britons are <em>&quot;sort of ok with it&quot;</em>.</p>

<h2>Enter &quot;Help to Buy&quot; scheme</h2>

<p>To address the housing needs, the Tory government has come up with <a href="http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/">Help to Buy</a>: you put 5% deposit (say £10k), the government puts 20% (say £40k) and you can now afford a home of up to £200k - you can easily find a bank that would give you
a Mortgage for <strong>75% LTV</strong>. It&#39;s like asking them for a glass of water: of course
they will have you as a customer.</p>

<p>This sounds great, but it&#39;s actually a recipe for disaster.</p>

<h2>Can I buy any kind of home with the HTB scheme?</h2>

<p>HTB has been launched in 2 phases in 2013: <strong>HTB1</strong> (<em>Equity Loan</em>) and <strong>HTB2</strong> (<em>Mortgage Guarantees</em>) first only applied for newly built homes,
now HTB can be used also to purchase pre-built homes. But ONLY in the formula HTB2:
instead of giving you 20% of the money, the HTB2 just makes the government guarantor
of your Mortgage.</p>

<p>All of those, capped to £600k.</p>

<p>Sounds good, right?
Not a bit. But first let&#39;s highlight the benefit.</p>

<h2>So, why everyone is buying so much if HTB is so bad?</h2>

<p>Because we are stupid. Humans rarely think long term.
All of a sudden, Bob (fictional character) can afford a much bigger house, and he
has to only provide 5% of deposit. Suddenly, life is amazing.</p>

<p>HTB works as a loan: once you buy, you are repaying the government a monthly installment
(to define with a HMRC official). First 5 years are interest free (WOW!) and then
it&#39;s like 1.5% + some increase over time. It&#39;s a great loan compared to any Mortgage.</p>

<p>If prices of houses were fair, this would be a great thing that would really
allow people to buy a home.</p>

<h2>Beyond their means</h2>

<p>In short, people are buying beyond their means.
Yes, you have taken 20% of the money with this great cheap loan, so in theory you
are saving loads of money. But still, you now have 2 loans: a Mortgage and the HTB loan.
Your credit score is affected. You are less &quot;trust worthy&quot; in case you need an emergency
loan.</p>

<p>And if that 5% deposit was already hard to put together, you are most certainly now
in a situation where ALL your income is taken by the repayments.
You can make it, but just a glitch in your monthly INs/OUTs and you are in trouble.</p>

<p>I have made my calculation, so it&#39;s possible to take the HTB and still be comfortably
between your means. But as a Software Engineer, my income is way above the national
average: I ought to be in this position.</p>

<h2>Builders are getting richer, at tax-payers expenses</h2>

<p>If house prices where a fixed value, this whole HTB thing would be great and Britain
would have no housing problems.</p>

<p>But the market laws are well known: flood the market with money, and prices will soar.
And that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. House prices are going drastically up because more people
can afford them all of a sudden.</p>

<p>That would be &quot;OK&quot; if there wasn&#39;t a party exploiting this.</p>

<p>What we forget to consider, is that Government&#39;s Money is OUR money. Is what every
month we pay in taxes. Is the the 20/30/40/50% of our monthly sweat that goes &quot;puff&quot;
so that the <em>&quot;Government Machine can keep cranking&quot;</em>. Mind you, I&#39;m not complaining
about this: this is what a government does - takes money from X to make Y happen.
It&#39;s sort-of an investment logic at play, on a country-scale.</p>

<p>The issue I have is that the HTB is being exploited BIG TIME by big house builders
(i.e. not your average tiny builder - we are talking about market-floating companies like
<a href="http://www.bewley.co.uk/">Bewley Homes</a>, <a href="http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/">Barrat / David Wilson</a>, <a href="https://bloorhomes.com/">Bloor Homes</a>, <a href="https://www.crestnicholson.com/">Crest Nicholson</a>...)
to squeeze as much money as possible out of buyers and government&#39;s pocket. That
at the end of the day are the same pocket!</p>

<p>And how they do that? How they maximise their profit? <strong>Withholding properties!</strong></p>

<p>Try to go to any site where they have set up a show-room and they are starting
to sell the first plots. They will tell you that &quot;only this much are available right now&quot;.
You will ask &quot;what&#39;s going to be available in X months?&quot;. They will show you what
but prices will not be available because, in X months, the very same house, built 50
meters down the same road, might be able to go on the market for £10/20k extra!</p>

<p>New homes increase the market-demand for homes. Even pre-owned. This is basic
economics that any university student has studied at some point. It&#39;s called
&quot;Fabricated Demand&quot;. You go down the street, and see signage of &quot;New Luxury Homes&quot; in
your neighbourhood. Your mind now wants to buy, but the new homes are too costly.
So you buy something else.</p>

<p>The houses on the market reduce in number, so what&#39;s left can ask for more money.
The builder knows that the customer can use HTB to &quot;spend that little extra for their
dream home&quot;. So they are ready to release houses at the right time. At a price that
maximise profit.</p>

<p>To prove that, check the price of homes that are above the HTB £600k threshold:
because HTB doesn&#39;t apply to them, their prices can&#39;t move as much. They incur the
risk of going &quot;out of market&quot;.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s different from the usual &quot;market rules&quot;</h2>

<p>What&#39;s different is that the HTB has injected money that have altered reality.
More money means pushing prices beyond the &quot;too expensive&quot; point. The point that
houses were supposed to reach, before demand will cease and sellers would be forced
to rethink their pricing.</p>

<p>Ah, and consider also that UK has done massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing">Quantitative Easing (QE)</a>: pretty much printing money.
This is where the Government gets the extra-edge to support HTB.</p>

<p>But QE is a dangerous thing to over-use: ultimately those extra money in the market
will be paid by the tax-payers, through massively inflated prices (i.e. <em>inflation baby!</em>).</p>

<h2>What happens once you can&#39;t repay your Mortgage?</h2>

<p><strong>Who cares! The builder is happy!</strong> Who is in trouble is the customer (that can&#39;t
repay the mortgage and loses his/her home) and the Government (that has lost
tax-payers money).</p>

<p>In this game, the loser is always you.
Unless you are a builder: in that case your third yacht is coming next week.</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;d call this ++a new house bubble++.</strong> But in a country where media are very much influenced by
government, mentioning bubble would probably get journalists fired...</p>
