<p>In the past few weeks/months an interesting trend started: game producers want to bring back to life genera that have come and gone.</p>

<p>The most famous (has been on the tech-news channels for weeks) is <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/66710809/double-fine-adventure">Double Fine Adventure</a>, the same people that have crafted incredible games that have <strong>colored</strong> my (our?) past:
<blockquote>
<strong>Double Fine Productions</strong></p>

<p>Founded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you&#39;ll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim&#39;s design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable &quot;Point-and-Click&quot; graphic adventure game for the modern age.
</blockquote></p>

<p>The Double Fine Adventure guys were asking for &quot;just&quot; $400,000 - they have raised a popping <strong>$3,336,371</strong>.</p>

<p>This has caused other similar, maybe less famous game designers/developers to try to emulate, and bring back to life classic games that we played (and sometimes loved): <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leisuresuitlarry/make-leisure-suit-larry-come-again">Leisure Suit Larry</a>, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1613260297/shadowrun-returns">Shadowrun</a> and others that I can&#39;t be asked now to fetch the URL of.</p>

<p>Cool shit.</p>

<h2>Why am I posting?</h2>

<p>Because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifrit">Ifrit</a>, the voice inside my head, is whispering me things:
<blockquote>
You fools! You will be so disappointed!</p>

<p>You are not the same people anymore: you have grown up! You like other shit now!</p>

<p>The only reason for which you are so happy to sponsor this stuff now is because you, as any other human being, are not immune from aging-induced-love.

</div>

<p>Well, Ifrit is trying to make me understand that, when older people were telling a young me (us?):
<blockquote>
When I was your age, shit was this, this or that!</p>

<p>Things were different, and we all loved doing that, this or those!</p>

<p>Now, look at you, doing that shit or this shit!
</blockquote></p>

<p>Are we sure Ifrit is not right? Are we sure we are not giving money <strong>to make old-games-come-back</strong> just because:
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s the <em>cool</em> thing to do</li>
<li>As any other class of humans (I put us in the techy/nerdy/geeky class), we too are sensitive to childhood memories</li>
<li>Now it&#39;s easy - we all have jobs: no need to ask mommy for money</li>
<li>We (desperately?) want to have THAT <em>fun</em> back</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>What are you saying? Am I crazy?!?!?</h2>

<p>Well, maybe. But I have played <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-secret-monkey-island-special/id324741347?mt=8">The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition</a>: after few hours of excitement, I finished the game for the sake of having spent money on it - definitely not for the same eager curiosity and fun that drove my young days.</p>

<p>Or I&#39;m just cynic tonight and I&#39;m going to love what those guys are going to do.</p>

<p>I putted my money on Double Fine Adventure for now...</p>

<h2>Before fire tongues start shouting at me</h2>

<p>I loved those games too. I&#39;d love to have a lot of fun with those characters again. I was just giving Ifrit his hour of light: he chose to spend it blogging. </p>
