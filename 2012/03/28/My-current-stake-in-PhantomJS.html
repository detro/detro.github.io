That’s when GhostDriver was born. The code is very young, and the list of TODO is as long as the amount of code written, but you can already: Start the RemoteWebDriver Server Run the “Getting Started” example if you already have PhantomJS on your system and you have Maven to build the example. Speed-wise, there is no comparison: respect to use FirefoxDriver, the test takes between a 1/5 and a 1/10 of the time.

<p>** Hey, why don’t you <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/ContributionGuide">give us a hand</a>? :) **</p>

</div>

<p>Here is where my stake is.</p>

<h2 id="repl">REPL</h2>

<p>I just finished putting down a new wiki page that explains a bit about the REPL and how it works. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/InteractiveModeREPL">Give it a read</a> and let me know if you want more clarification.</p>

<p>I can already see few problems with it, as it doesn’t always behave as I want. I’m sure this is the beginning of the work on this feature, not the end. But it is a good start.</p>

<h2 id="ghostdriver">GhostDriver</h2>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=49">Issue #49 - “Integrate with WebDriver”</a> was opened in February 29 2011! Yes, more than 1 year ago.</p>

<p>So, last week I started hacking away on a new idea: now that PhantomJS has the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webserver</code> moduel (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require("webserver").create()</code>), it is possible to implement the full <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol">WebDriver Wire Protocol</a> and have PhantomJS act as a back-end for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RemoteWebDriver</code>.</p>

<p>That’s when <a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver">GhostDriver</a> was born.</p>

<p>The code is very young, and the list of TODO is as long as the amount of code written, but you can already:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start the RemoteWebDriver Server</li>
  <li>Run the “Getting Started” example</li>
</ul>

<p>if you already have PhantomJS on your system and you have Maven to build the example.</p>

<p>Speed-wise, there is no comparison: respect to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver">FirefoxDriver</a>, <strong>the test takes between a 1/5 and a 1/10 of the time</strong>. When you launch GhostDriver on the side and than make the test hit it, it’s when you get the maximum performances.</p>

<p>Give it a go and let me know if the instructions provided are clear enough.</p>

<h2 id="selenium-conference-2012-london-uk">Selenium Conference 2012, London, UK</h2>

<p>I managed to get a talk accepted for the <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/">Selenium Conference 2012</a>, that this year will be hosted in London at the “IET London: Savoy Place” (<a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/tickets/">tickets here</a> / <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/venue/">venue</a>).</p>

Yes, I'm :)

<p>The title of my talk couldn’t be more <em>ostentatious</em>:</p>

<p>like I have any idea of what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you come along and say hi, I’ll be pleased. Hopefully I won’t bore anyone to death.</p>
