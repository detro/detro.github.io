                <h2>GhostDriver, 90% and priorities</h2>
<p class="meta">04 Oct 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Last few weeks have been HECTIC to say the least. Work on <a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver">GhostDriver</a> and <a href="https://github.com/detro/phantomjs/tree/ghostdriver-dev">related PhantomJS improvements</a> has been very intense.</p>

<p>We just shipped <a href="http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2012/09/phantomjs-1-7-blazing-star.html">PhantomJS 1.7</a>, and work for 1.8 is already started (check out the <code>ghostdriver-dev</code> branch I linked above).</p>

<p>GhostDriver has reached almost 90% completion for 1.0, and the code is being <strong>hardened</strong>, thanks also to the amazing work that <a href="http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.co.uk/">Jim Evans</a> is doing at spotting issues and, a lot of times, providing fixes. GhostDriver is getting better and better thanks to you Jim.</p>

<h2>Yes, but in short, what&#39;s left to do?</h2>

<p>Based on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am63grtxc7bDdGNqX1ZPX2VoZlE2ZHZhd09lNDkzbkE">my plan</a>, to release 1.0 I&#39;m missing &quot;only&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li>Handling of <code>window.alert</code>, <code>window.confirm</code> and <code>window.prompt</code></li>
<li>Handling of <code>LocalStorage</code> and <code>SessionStorage</code></li>
<li>Handling fo <code>/log</code> commands</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently though I have been thinking and discussing with others and I decided that I&#39;d delay the support for those 3 things in favour of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix issues related to Mouse interaction</li>
<li>Integrate GhostDriver into PhantomJS itself (I need to prepare a plan with <a href="ariya.ofilabs.com">Ariya</a>)</li>
<li>Providing a Java Binding (Jim Evans already pushed a .Net binding into the Selenium codebase)</li>
<li>Code hardening</li>
</ul>

<h2>WHAAAAT? Are you crazy? No &quot;alert()&quot;?</h2>

<p>Yeah, I know. While <code>LocalStorage</code> can be seen as <em>nice-to-have</em> features for <code>1.0</code>, being able to interact with <code>alert()</code> (and relata) is a big deal.</p>

<p>The issue there is that the current PhantomJS doesn&#39;t provide an easy way to implement those commands: while PhantomJS does provide support for <code>alert</code>, <code>prompt</code> and <code>confirm</code> (I wrote them myself!),  it will probably require quite some work to &quot;adapt&quot; PhantomJS/GhostDriver to the way the WebDriver API work for those things.</p>

<p>In short: PhantomJS allows you to register a <code>onAlert/onConfirm/onPrompt</code> callback to handle those events - WebDriver treats those as a &quot;state&quot; in which the Window is. Maybe I could write a never-returning callback? I don&#39;t know, it requires time to think about the best solution.</p>

<p>And that the point: I think I got no time now.</p>

<h2>The best thing I can do right now</h2>

<p><strong>Time</strong> is key here.</p>

<p>I think the best thing I can do right now for the <strong>PhantomJS WebDriver project future</strong>, is to release a 1.0 version, with the hope it will receive enough <em>road test</em>, so that 1.1 and later can be better, comprehensive, more <em>WebDriver-worthy</em>.</p>

<p>Ah, and did I mention that I&#39;m moving to <a href="http://corporate.blog.lovefilm.com/">Amazon LoveFilm</a>? But that&#39;s for another post...</p>
