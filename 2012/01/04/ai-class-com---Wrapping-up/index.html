                <p>I have been thinking about what to write in this post since the day I took the final exam of the <a href="http://www.ai-class.com">Stanford Online AI Class</a>. I have so many things to say (and still to do), that I have a <em>mess</em> of mixed thoughts in my head.</p>

<p>So, I apologise in advance if thoughts will sound a bit random.</p>

<h2>Amazing experience</h2>

<p>That&#39;s what this class has been for me. I have learnt tons of new things, all thanks to the great work of prof. <a href="http://robots.stanford.edu/">Thrun</a> and <a href="http://norvig.com/">Norvig</a>. I digged into the amazing topic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>, and now I feel a bit more &quot;round&quot; as a Computer Scientist.</p>

<p>The final score? <strong>98.7%</strong>. Not bad at all!</p>

<h3>Massive class</h3>

<p>Probably the most amazing aspect of what those prof. have achieved, is to work with <strong>~160-thousands students</strong>, from all around the world. Yes, we had indeed issues with servers going down on deadlines, and we didn&#39;t manage to do much programming (checking the code of such a massive class requires a re-thinking in homework-checking-approaches), but we still got lessons being delivered on time, a perfectly working and useful forum, a community of students discussing the lessons and so forth.</p>

<p>Being this the first of a growing number of Teaching-Experiments, I truly feel like having taken part to a tiny piece of History.</p>

<h3>A Privilege and a Realisation</h3>

<p>I was born in the south of Italy, from a family that was wealthy enough to raise 5 kids (I&#39;m the first), but not enough to send us study farther than few kilometres from home. So I always looked at universities like Stanford (actually, Stanford in particular!) as my <em>dreamland of study</em>.</p>

<p>Being able to take part, even for just 1 class and only online, to a class thought by <em>figures</em> like Norvig and Thrun was a real privilege. I wish one day to drive to Stanford, find their office and just shake their hands (should I bring them a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiera">Pastiera</a>? what do you recon?).</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, being able to follow, and perform also quite well makes me see that, after all, my <em>modest</em> <a href="http://www.unina.it/index.jsp">University of Studies of Naples &quot;Federico II&quot;</a> was not bad at all: with a smaller budget and less pompous name, it has been able to make of me a Computer Scientist that can compare himself to Stanford Graduates. A big thank you to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Naples_Federico_II">world oldest state university</a>.</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>

<p>During this class I had discovered that I haven&#39;t changed much: to learn, I still need to take lots of notes. This is good, but also consumes tons of paper. And when I started I was not willing to waste paper in 2011 for class notes: I wanted to change approach.</p>

<p>I so decided to start writing my notes in an Evernote Notebook. What I didn&#39;t realise, was that I had unconsciously made a commitment!</p>

<p>My notebook &quot;<a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/detro/aiclass">Online Stanford AI Class</a>&quot; has got very quickly popular, and people started to <em>politely</em> (and sometimes <em>less politely</em>) demand for notes about the classes, while the course was underway. Some were just thanking with comments on the blog, others posted corrections or highlighted typos. I quickly found a massive traffic coming through and I was not really expecting that.</p>

<p>I thank everyone of the <em>users</em> of those notes for the kind words, and I&#39;m humbled that my private effort (I wrote them as my own reference after all), written in very poor ital-english, has been helpful to some.</p>

<p><strong>YES, I KNOW</strong>: I still haven&#39;t published the notes for the last 2 classes about Natural Language Processing. When the Final Exam came out, and I realised no questions were related to that topic, I decide to focus on the Exam. Afterwards, I left for holiday to Italy. Hopefully I&#39;ll get around to write them soon. I really want to go through again those last lessons, as Norvig gave a very good basis to do work on concrete NLP problems.</p>

<h3>A request to the professors</h3>

<p>In the spirit of sharing and <em>global-ness</em>, I think is really important that <strong>all the data about the class participation and performance is made publicly available</strong>. After proper anonymization (of course!), we should get the details about students location, background and class performance. I&#39;m sure tons of interesting data can be extracted and fact understood.</p>

<p>This was, indeed, <strong>one of the biggest experiments</strong> involving massive knowledge sharing: I&#39;m sure there is lot to learn from those data about teaching in the modern world.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>

<p>Just in case you missed, above is the video of a <a href="https://plus.google.com/109050230672993035916/posts">Google+ Hangout</a> that has happened during the course, involving both the profs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan_(educator">Sal Khan</a>) of the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>: the topic discussed there fit exactly with what I&#39;m mentioning here. I leave Khan to put it in way better words.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>What I got as most important outcome from all this, is that now I have answers to some of the &quot;curiosity&quot; I got left from my University times, when I had to rush through the Bachelor Degree, and couldn&#39;t stay to do the Master (I needed the start working and make money). Yes, there are still advanced topics in the field of Machine Learning and Optimisation that I&#39;d love to go through, but this is a start!</p>

<p>Why I don&#39;t study now by myself you say? Because it&#39;s not the same! I don&#39;t know you, but having someone teaching you a topic gradually, and setting up schedules and deadlines for you, forces you into a <em>study mode</em> that it&#39;s just very hard to achieve on your own. Don&#39;t you agree?</p>

<h3>Job opportunity letter from Thrun</h3>

<p>Yes, in addition to the learning, I also got an email from prof. Thrun about the fact that he would like to pass around our CV (i.e. the first 1000 of the class), as <em>they are looking for talents like ours</em>.</p>

<p>That is really great, even thought <a href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2011/12/14/Crossing-the-pond">I just got a new job</a> and I&#39;m not really looking for a new one. Networking is always useful, even more if it&#39;s purely based on what I tangibly demonstrated.</p>

<h3>Proud</h3>

<p>Well, what else to say? <strong>I&#39;m proud</strong>. That&#39;s what I can ultimately take out of this experience. I learnt tons and from the best, I performed well and I helped others do the same. Once in a while, it&#39;s good to feel proud of yourself.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>

<p>Well, first of all I need to resume my work on <a href="http://www.phantomjs.org">PhantomJS</a>: I have been (almost totally) away from the project in the last 2 months, and I still have <a href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2011/11/01/REPL-and-HTTP-Mapping-ideas-to-contribute-to-PhantomJS">stuff I want to do</a>, and new things I want to investigate.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m in the middle of a revolution, that is going to make me travel every couple of months across the Atlantic to <a href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2011/12/14/Crossing-the-pond">work in Neustar Webmetrics</a>. It&#39;s going to be quite a change and a life-changing experience.</p>

<p>Of course, I do feel like this course opened for me the proverbial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora&#x27;s_box">Pandora&#39;s Box</a>. Professors at Stanford are putting online more, very interesting courses, and I&#39;m thinking about some of them: &quot;<a href="http://www.launchpad-class.org/">The Lean Launchpad</a>&quot; it&#39;s probably a great one to follow at my age and career stage; also &quot;<a href="http://www.nlp-class.org/">Natural Language Processing</a>&quot; attracts me a lot, because we did just a quick dip from prof. Norvig and I want to know more; &quot;<a href="http://www.hci-class.org/">Human Computer Interaction</a>&quot; sounds like a great way to compensate for the bad class I got at uni years ago!</p>

<p>So, in other words, I&#39;m not going to roll my thumbs. 2012 is going to be a very busy year, full of new things!</p>

<p><em>See you around and... happy coding!</em></p>
