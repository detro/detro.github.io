<div class="post">
<p>This post is long overdue. It&#39;s weeks that I HAVE TO write it and
yet couldn&#39;t find the time to put it together. Oh well, better late than...</p>

<p>Since my talk about
<a href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2012/05/01/Me-the-Selenium-Conference-2012">GhostDriver at the Selenium Conference 2012</a>
I have
received lots of interest from the community about
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/">GhostDriver</a>: finally a
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/">WebDriver</a> for
<a href="http://phantomjs.org">PhantomJS</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t followed me so far, a quick <em>catch up</em>: I&#39;m working to implement
the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol">WebDriver WireProtocol</a>
on the top of PhantomJS, so to leverage our favorite
<strong>headless browser</strong>. The project is proceeding, even though not as fast
as I would have liked: you can find details about the current status
in the &quot;official&quot; <a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>
and/or checking out the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am63grtxc7bDdGNqX1ZPX2VoZlE2ZHZhd09lNDkzbkE">&quot;Implemented Commands&quot; spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="http://digilander.libero.it/yappappeo/mezzopienomezzovuoto.jpg" "Half full or half empty?" />
</div>

<p><strong>We have implemented almost 50% of the WireProtocol</strong>. Not as far as I&#39;d like
this to be, but with my current workload it&#39;s a good thing it&#39;s moving.</p>

<h2>Contributions, finally!</h2>

<p>I say &quot;We&quot; because I have been joined by
<a href="https://github.com/alxndrsn">Alex Anderson</a>: Alex has quietly started
submitting patch and providing a very good push toward completion. He is
contributing many commands and spotting bugs. He has even created
a <a href="https://github.com/alxndrsn/webdriver-geb-tests">dedicated test suite</a>,
written using <a href="http://www.gebish.org/">Geb</a>.</p>

<p>Others are trying to help as well, and that is great. I only ask a couple
of things to a potential contributor:</p>

<ul>
<li>stick with the coding style I have set</li>
<li>if you can&#39;t &quot;infer&quot; my coding style, we have a problem already</li>
<li>if you want to make a radical change, be ready to motivate it</li>
<li>code speaks better than any promise</li>
<li>tests are a great way to start your contributions</li>
<li>this is not a democracy (sorry), but win me with reasoning
and I&#39;ll bend backward to do what you suggest</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I being too demanding? :)</p>

<h2>Changes to PhantomJS needed</h2>

<p>GhostDriver is being a great &quot;benchmark&quot; for PhantomJS: having to implement
a protocol that is designed for real browsers, current limitations
of PhantomJS are popping out.</p>

<p>If you have took a look at the README I mention above, you have probably
noticed that to run GhostDriver you need to use my personal branch of PhantomJS
called <a href="https://github.com/detro/phantomjs/tree/ghostdriver-dev">ghostdriver-dev</a>.
That contains changes to make PhantomJS
do what the WireProtocol demands.</p>

<p>I have managed to merge the current status of this branch back into PhantomJS
and it&#39;s part of the
<a href="http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2012/06/phantomjs-1-6-lavender.html">freshly baked 1.6 &quot;Lavender&quot;</a>.
Some interesting new features are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Page rendering to Base64: <code>page.renderBase64(format = &quot;png&quot;)</code></li>
<li>Page <code>frame</code> and <code>iframe</code> navigation: <code>page.switchToFrame(&quot;frame_name&quot;)</code></li>
<li>Callbacks for <code>window.confirm(message)</code> and <code>window.prompt(text, value)</code></li>
<li>Info about the hosting Operating System: <code>require(&quot;system&quot;)[&quot;os&quot;]</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>What&#39;s coming</h2>

<p>Well, while Alex is pushing in new commands, my next focus is windows handling:
a WebDriver needs to be able to manipulate and move focus of execution across
all the open windows. That&#39;s another thing that requires work on the PhantomJS
side, as we currently don&#39;t support that.</p>

<p>But Qt is awesome and I&#39;m confident it&#39;s doable and will probably be not
that hard.</p>

<p>Wish us good luck: we are not there yet, but we are well motivated.</p>

<h2>Can I ask you a favor?</h2>

<p>If you plan to use GhostDriver inside your project,
could you please leave a comment? Who are you? What you work on? How is GhostDriver going to be useful for you?</p>

<p>Thanks. Knowing stuff like that would give me some perspective.</p>
