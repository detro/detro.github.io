<p class="meta">06 Aug 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p><strong>SPOILER</strong>: <em>this article assumes quite a lot of things about your knowledge of binary trees and data structure. I won&#39;t spend much time introducing concepts. Deal with it.</em></p>

<p>Some time ago I had the pleasure to meet with <a href="http://chrislord.net/blog/">Chris Lord</a>, who introduced me to the concept of Binary Tree Traversal without using neither a stack/queue or recursion.</p>

<p>The list of requirements that such algorithm has to fulfil:</p>

<ul>
<li>Constant Space: no extra data structure to do the traversal</li>
<li>Non-destructive: once finished, the tree needs to be exactly how it was before the visit</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounded <em>crazy</em> initially, but than I looked into it more deeply and discovered, thanks to some pointers from <a href="http://twitter.com/lucabox">Luca Colantonio</a>, that there is an algorithm <em>in literature</em> that does just that: <strong>Morris In-Order</strong> Traversal.</p>

<p>Morris does just that - and a very good description of how it works can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5506601/1389112">on Stack Overflow</a>. I suggest you have a good read and come back: pointless of me to repeat it here.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>You back? Great!</p>

<p>So, before &quot;discovering&quot; the Morris algorithm, I was trying to write a solution myself. My basic idea was to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move downwards</li>
<li>Manipulate pointers to the branch we are about to explore, to point backward so we have &quot;a way back&quot;</li>
<li>Restore once done with that branch</li>
</ol>

<p>At that stage, it had not occur to me to try to manipulate the entire tree structure like Morris does: I wanted to be very subtle, with the data structure resembling the original tree (though, with backward pointers).</p>

<p>The key issue I hit? <strong>Going Backward</strong>. Once I&#39;m done visiting the branches of a node, I need to go back to the parent (to which I have a pointer too), and restore the structure.</p>

<p><strong>But HOW am I going to reconstruct the tree?</strong> How do I know if the Branch I just visited was the <em>left</em> or the <em>right</em> branch of the parent I want to move back to?</p>

<h2>Downsize the problem</h2>

<p>In a general Binary Tree, there is no guarantee of the order and distribution of nodes. It&#39;s just a tree where every node has 0, 1 or 2 child nodes. I didn&#39;t have any &quot;rule&quot; on which to <strong>build a backward-restoring logic</strong>.</p>

<p>But then I had an idea: what about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">BSTs (Binary Search Tree)</a>? In those trees, there is a strong order relationship between a node and its childs.</p>

<p>This means that at any moment in time, once I&#39;m done visiting a branch, I can reconstruct <em>where I&#39;m coming from</em>, looking at the values of the parent and the child:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">parent-&gt;value &gt; child-&gt;value ? is_left_child : is_right_child
</code></pre></div>
<p>And, so I wrote the <strong>De Marino BST Post-Order Traversal</strong> algorithm:
[sourcecode:c]
void de<em>marino</em>bst<em>post</em>order_traversal(node *root) {
    node *curr = root;  //&lt; current node
    node *par = NULL;   //&lt; parent of current node
    node *next = root;  //&lt; next node to traversal (but sometimes, just temp variable)
    int dir = DOWN;     //&lt; direction in which we are moving</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">do {
    if (dir == DOWN &amp;&amp; curr-&gt;left != NULL) {
        // Go down left
        next = curr-&gt;left;
        curr-&gt;left = par;
        par = curr;
        curr = next;
    } else if (dir == DOWN &amp;&amp; curr-&gt;right != NULL) {
        // Go down right
        next = curr-&gt;right;
        curr-&gt;right = par;
        par = curr;
        curr = next;
    } else {
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, curr != NULL ? curr-&gt;value : -1);

        if (par-&gt;value &gt; curr-&gt;value &amp;&amp; par-&gt;right != NULL) {
            // Go down right, coming from left
            // NOTE: order gives us a hint about where we come from
            dir = DOWN;

            next = par-&gt;left;   // hold the way back
            par-&gt;left = curr;
            curr = par-&gt;right;
            par-&gt;right = next;  // store the way back in the right child of par now
            next = curr;
        } else {
            dir = UP;

            if (par-&gt;value &gt; curr-&gt;value) {
                // Go up, coming from left
                // NOTE: order gives us a hint about where we come from
                next = par-&gt;left;
                par-&gt;left = curr;
            } else {
                // Go up, coming from right
                // NOTE: order gives us a hint about where we come from
                next = par-&gt;right;
                par-&gt;right = curr;
            }
            curr = par;
            par = next;
        }
    }
} while(next != NULL &amp;&amp; par != NULL);
printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, curr != NULL ? curr-&gt;value : -1);
</code></pre></div>

[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m almost 100% sure that I&#39;m not the first one to <em>stumble</em> into something like this, but for now I&#39;m unable to find anything in literature - <em>cough</em> ... Google ... <em>cough</em> .</p>

<h2>An advantage over Morris</h2>

<p>Yes, this algorithm requires the <strong>strong condition of BST</strong> while Morris works with any Binary Tree. That&#39;s a given. But this algorithm is also <strong>faster</strong>: it doesn&#39;t go deep into the tree to find the rightmost left child of a node, like Morris. From a quick look <strong>the computation is linear - O(n)</strong>: every node is visited only once. But maybe I&#39;m overlooking something in Morris.</p>

<h2>Far from perfect</h2>

<p>I&#39;m also sure that this algorithm is <strong>far from bug-less</strong>: I have spent on it less than 24h between coding and thinking. So, please, to all the Computer Scientists people out there: let me know your thoughts and critics. This is a great way to spend some of that theory that we have in our heads.</p>

<p>I have added this code to my <a href="https://github.com/detro/coding-exercises/commits/master">coding exercises</a> repo on GitHub, if you want to try it out (check latest commits).</p>

<p>Now, as I expect, feel free to ignore my warnings and start your opinionated trashing - I&#39;m pretty confident I&#39;d deserve it. :)</p>
