                <h2>Scope 'this', and scope 'that'</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Feb 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>As a guy that tries to live his professional life in the middle of the dichotomy &quot;C/C++ - JavaScript&quot;, I often find myself discussing the discrepancies, differences and implementation details of the <em>latter</em> (an half-assed prototypal language) using the <em>former</em>.</p>

<p>The other day I was chatting with Luca (@lucabox) about <strong>scope</strong> in JS, and we were describing the different situations you can end up with... and how we work our way out of those culprits.</p>

<p>What I did later on, was picking up <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/">JS-Bible</a> and go to Chapter 4, <em>Functions</em>. I strongly advice you get yourself one and read that chapter again and again, as I did now for the 3rd time. Every time there is a little bit of news to grow your knowledge. That book has to stay on your desk, at any time.</p>

<p>After that I did the obvious: <code>git checkout master &amp;&amp; qmake &amp;&amp; make</code> my beloved <a href="http://www.phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> and started fiddling around.</p>

<p>In Chapter 4 of Crockford&#39;s there is a section called <em>&quot;Invocation&quot;</em>: there The Man highlights the 4 Invocation Patterns that can be used in JavaScript. What I wrote was a practical demonstration of those patterns: this way it would be an easy documentation of how <strong>functional scoping is such a tricky <em>bitch</em> to handle</strong>.</p>

<h2>The &quot;subject&quot;</h2>

<p>First, I wrote this function:
[sourcecode:javascript]
var foo, obj, that, Constructor, ClosuredScope;
aVariable = &quot;I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)&quot;;</p>

<p>// &#39;foo&#39;, but no &#39;bar&#39;
foo = function(callMessage) {
    console.log(&quot;\n\033[0;32m&quot; + callMessage + &quot; {\033[0m&quot;);    //&lt; console.log(callMessage + &quot;{&quot;);</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">console.log(aVariable);
console.log(this.aVariable);
console.log(window.aVariable);
if (typeof(that) != &quot;undefined&quot; &amp;&amp; that.aVariable) {
    console.log(that.aVariable + &quot; (passed via \033[0;31m&#39;that&#39;\033[0m)&quot;);
}
if (this === window) {
    console.log(&quot;Here \033[0;31m&#39;this&#39;\033[0m resolves to \033[0;31m&#39;window&#39;\033[0m&quot;);
}

console.log(&quot;\033[0;32m}\033[0m\n&quot;);                        //&lt; console.log(&quot;}&quot;);
</code></pre></div>
<p>};
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>What this those is reading the value of <code>aVariable</code>, taking it <strong>implicitly from the current scope</strong> and <strong>explicitly from <code>this</code></strong> (i.e. pointer to the current <em>scope</em>) and ** from <code>window</code>** (i.e. the gloval <em>scope</em>). Also, it does a couple of extra bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checks if there is <code>that.aVariable</code> in the current scope (in case we are using the famous <code>that = this</code> trick)</li>
<li>Highlights when the magical JS Runtime is using the global scope (<code>window</code>) as local scope (<code>this</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, and I added some bash colouring to my print-out: I like to have the key stuff highlighted to me.</p>

<h2>Function Invocation Pattern</h2>

<p>I started with something very easy:
[sourcecode:javascript]
// Function Invocation Pattern
foo(&quot;*** Proving the &#39;Function Invocation Pattern&#39; ***&quot;);
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>that will print out:
[sourcecode:console]
*** Proving the &#39;Function Invocation Pattern&#39; *** {
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
Here &#39;this&#39; is equal to &#39;window&#39;
}
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>What&#39;s happening here is obvious: <strong>the scope in which the invocation is executed, is parent of the internal scope of the callee</strong>. Hence, if a variable is not found in the local scope, will be looked-up in the parent scopes(s).</p>

<p>But we all knew that, didn&#39;t we?</p>

<h2>Method Invocation Pattern</h2>

<p>Now, let&#39;s start to have some fun:
[sourcecode:javascript]
// Method Invocation Pattern
obj = {
    aVariable : &quot;I&#39;m a String in an object (i.e. scope/&#39;this&#39;)&quot;,
    foo : foo
};
obj.foo(&quot;*** Proving the &#39;Method Invocation Pattern&#39; ***&quot;);
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>the above will print:
[sourcecode:console]
*** Proving the &#39;Method Invocation Pattern&#39; *** {
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String in an object (i.e. scope/&#39;this&#39;)
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
}
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>The object <code>obj</code> to which we added a reference to foo, now acts as the scope parenting the internal function scope. Hence, <code>aVariable</code> is found in <code>obj</code>, set to something different. In other words, during the invocation the function run in a scope where <code>obj === this</code>.</p>

<h2>Constructor Invocation Pattern + Prototype Inheritance</h2>

<p>[sourcecode:javascript]
// Constructor Invocation Pattern + Prototype Inheritance
Constructor = function(s) {
    this.aVariable = s;
};
Constructor.prototype.foo = foo;
obj = new Constructor(&quot;I&#39;m a String in an object (i.e. scope/&#39;this&#39;), assigned via a Constructor&quot;);
obj.foo(&quot;*** Proving the &#39;Constructor Invocation Pattern + Prototype Inheritance&#39; ***&quot;);
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>predictably this prints:
[sourcecode:console]
*** Proving the &#39;Constructor Invocation Pattern + Prototype Inheritance&#39; *** {
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String in an object (i.e. scope/&#39;this&#39;), assigned via a Constructor
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
}
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>when I was working at Betfair, I found this kind of inheritance in the hierarchy we used, and all was based on <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/2/">YUI2</a>. Than moved to more Closure-based inheritances with <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/">YUI3</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a bad pattern per se, and makes it pretty clear to understand what&#39;s going on, but it does not offer the protection of Closures.</p>

<h2>Constructor Invocation Pattern + Closure</h2>

<p>Here I have to take a bit of &quot;liberty&quot; and make some ugly detour:
[sourcecode:javascript]
ClosuredScope = function(s) {
    var aVariable = s;
    this.aVariable = s;
    this.fooWrapper = function(m) { foo(m); console.log(aVariable + &quot; (from the wrapper)&quot;); };
    this.fooOriginal = foo;
};
obj = new ClosuredScope(&quot;I&#39;m a String in an object (i.e. scope/&#39;this&#39;), accessible via Closure&quot;);
obj.fooOriginal(&quot;*** Proving the &#39;Constructor Invocation Pattern + Closure&#39; (original) <strong><em>&quot;);
obj.fooWrapper(&quot;</em></strong> Proving the &#39;Constructor Invocation Pattern + Closure&#39; (wrapper) ***&quot;);
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>that prints out:
[sourcecode:console]
*** Proving the &#39;Constructor Invocation Pattern + Closure&#39; (original) *** {
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String in an object (i.e. scope/&#39;this&#39;), accessible via Closure
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
}</p>

<p>*** Proving the &#39;Constructor Invocation Pattern + Closure&#39; (wrapper) *** {
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
Here &#39;this&#39; resolves to &#39;window&#39;
}</p>

<p>I&#39;m a String in an object (i.e. scope/&#39;this&#39;), accessible via Closure (from the wrapper)
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>In the first invocation (i.e. <code>obj.fooOriginal(...)</code>) the callee acts as expected: same printout as per the Prototype Inheritance. But when invoked by <code>obj.fooWrapper(...)</code> <code>obj</code>&#39;s scope is not made parent of the callee scope, as it is invoked <em>as-is</em> (i.e. <code>foo(m);</code>).</p>

<p>A Closure though was indeed created: <code>console.log(aVariable + &quot; (from the wrapper)&quot;);</code> proves just that.</p>

<h2>Apply Invocation Pattern</h2>

<p>[sourcecode:javascript]
foo.apply({
    aVariable : &quot;I&#39;m a String set via the &#39;apply&#39; method: scope/&#39;this&#39; is passed to &#39;apply()&#39;&quot;
}, [&quot;*** Proving the &#39;Apply Invocation Pattern&#39; ***&quot;]);
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>obviously produces:
[sourcecode:console]
*** Proving the &#39;Apply Invocation Pattern&#39; *** {
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String set via the &#39;apply&#39; method: scope/&#39;this&#39; is passed to &#39;apply()&#39;
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
}
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>this is the easiest one, as the scope manipulation is made very explicit, and controlled by the developer. Useful when you want to tightly control what your callee receives.</p>

<h2><code>var that = this</code> Invocation Pattern</h2>

<p>If you wrote a lot of JavaScript, you have written one of this. Somewhere in time, you had a piece of code that drove you nuts for a little while, because the scope was just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Abagnale">Frank Abagnale</a>. Hence, to trap it, you created a fixed reference to it, an <em>&quot;alias&quot;</em> some would say.
[sourcecode:javascript]
// &#39;that&#39; = &#39;this&#39; Invocation Pattern
ClosuredScope = function(s) {
    this.aVariable = s;
    return {
        aVariable : this.aVariable,
        that : this,
        fooThat : foo
    };
};
obj = new ClosuredScope(&quot;I&#39;m a String set in another Closure&quot;);
obj.fooThat(&quot;*** Proving the &#39;That = This Invocation Pattern&#39; ***&quot;);
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>and this one comes out with:
[sourcecode:console]
*** Proving the &#39;That = This Invocation Pattern&#39; *** {
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String set in another Closure
I&#39;m a String in a global (attached to &#39;window&#39;)
I&#39;m a String set in another Closure (passed via &#39;that&#39;)
}
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>what&#39;s the reason? it&#39;s the only way to <em>&quot;catch and hold&quot;</em> <code>this</code>, the scope. <code>that</code> is than a reference to <code>this</code>, to ensure the callee can still get hold of it. And yes, this is a Closure.</p>

<p>What do you say? Too messy? Well, the <code>that = this</code>-for-dummies is:
[sourcecode:javascript]
// ...
var that = this;
 setTimeout(function () {
     that.doStuff();
 }, 1000);
// ...
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>but the same applies.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Well, after all this the only real conclusion I can give you is: be careful when writing JavaScript, and make sure you really understand what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Tools like PhantomJS, <a href="http://getfirebug.com">Firebug</a>, <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebInspector">WebKit Inspector</a> or <a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/">Opera Dragonfly</a> (choose your favourite), are your best friends to workout what&#39;s going on. When your code grows, it&#39;s not always YOUR code: breakpointing and analysing in details what&#39;s going on it&#39;s often the only way to solve this kind of issues.</p>

<p>And you, tweeps: please share your wisdom. I&#39;m sure you guys will have loads to say about this ;-) .</p>

<p><em>Happy scoping!</em></p>
