<div class="post">
<p>Articles <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/australia/the-webkit-prefix-will-ruin-the-mobile-web/669">like this one</a> and initiatives like &quot;<a href="http://codepo8.github.com/prefix-the-web/">pre-fix the Web</a>&quot;, aim to highlight to web-developers how important is to <strong>build a cross-browser web</strong>. The importance of such a point has been explained in so many places, there is no point in me saying anymore. People  like <a href="http://nefariousdesigns.co.uk/">Tim Huegdon</a> can give you a far better lesson on this.</p>

<p>But if you are after a &quot;<strong>one sentence to blame them all</strong>&quot;:
<blockquote>
If you write a website caring only to test it on WebKit based browser (worse, only your iPhone!!!), you are a <strong>MORON</strong>.
</blockquote></p>

<p>Recently I happened to re-read the &quot;<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/">How Browsers Work: Behind the scenes of modern web browsers</a>&quot; and precisely the section about the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#HTML_Parser"><em>forgiving</em> HTML Parser</a>. I ask
myself: why did we (the <em>web people</em>) cheer at HTML5 and <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2009#entry-6601">killed XHTML2</a>, if not for
the forgiveness? Didn&#39;t we do this to <em>&quot;lower the bar&quot;</em>, to allow <em>&quot;your young cousin to write website for his dad&#39;s business&quot;</em>?</p>

<p>We do spend <strong>LOADS</strong> of time pushing our self and colleagues to adopt best practice, validate code and so forth (and that is great!). Why do we fail to make the logic step of thinking:
<blockquote>
The guy that I swear at for using <code>-webkit-*</code> only prefixes, is the same guy that uses/abuses the HTML parser!
</blockquote></p>

<p>On one side we help, and sometimes even endorse <em>stupid</em> people,
because we want the web to be accessible (I guess) to young and
non-experienced (more content on the web == better web ???). But when they use it to do <strong>proprietary shit</strong>, things <em>we would have not expected or hoped for</em>, then we go on berserk (I&#39;m the first to do it!) and start talking like grandpas recalling Vietnam when their nephew Is preparing to leave for Iraq:
<blockquote>
...
It&#39;s Internet Explorer monopoly all over again!
...
Stop WebKit from taking over the web!
...
</blockquote></p>

<p>A question: what about enforcing HTML parser to be less forgiving? What about a <strong>shame-banner</strong> built in the browser appearing on the top of the viewport, saying:
<blockquote>
This site is shite! Who made this is a moron!
</blockquote></p>

<p><em>I&#39;m only half joking</em>: either we want stupid people writing bad websites, or we don&#39;t. Either we want an easy to access, low-bar web, or we want a web of experts, computer scientists even, that know what-the-fuck they are doing.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your take?</p>
