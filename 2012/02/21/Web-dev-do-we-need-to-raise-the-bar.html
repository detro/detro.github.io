<p>Recently I happened to re-read the “<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/">How Browsers Work: Behind the scenes of modern web browsers</a>” and precisely the section about the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#HTML_Parser"><em>forgiving</em> HTML Parser</a>.

myself: why did we (the <em>web people</em>) cheer at HTML5 and <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2009#entry-6601">killed XHTML2</a>, if not for

<p>A question: what about enforcing HTML parser to be less forgiving? What about a <strong>shame-banner</strong> built in the browser appearing on the top of the viewport, saying:</p>
