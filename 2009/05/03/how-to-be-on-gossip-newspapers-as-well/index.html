<li>Be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi">Media-Dictator in a semi-democratic country</a>. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a>, for example</li>
<li>Act like a stereotyped Italian clown in every International Meeting, pretending you are the one of the politicians that "actually do the job"</li>
<li>Enjoy yourself with the youngest and stupidest show-girls during your 70, just to confirm, again and again, the shameless stereotype of the "Italian playboy"</li>
<li>Have a wife that, after she was "seduced" by your money and your power when you were younger, making your first marriage fail, now complains for your unfaithfulness and the shame you are bringing to the family</li>
<li>and, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8031520.stm">make your wife ask for divorce now</a></li>
