<div class="post">
<p>After I received an email, this imaginary story came to my mind:
<blockquote>
<strong>Kiddo&gt;</strong>Mom, my friend <em><a href="http://developer.android.com/">G. Android</a></em> came today at school and said &quot;he is Open Source and it&#39;s cooooool&quot;. Not everyone understood in it and ignored him. Then we all got it, and he became very popular. <em>Can I do it too? Pleeeeeease!!!</em>
<strong>Mom&gt;</strong>Ok <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">S. Symbian</a>, but don&#39;t forget that you need to explain IP, binary compatibility, Active Objects, Descriptors... and you can&#39;t give away all the secrets of your mommy away to those Open Source folks.
<strong>Kiddo&gt;</strong>But moooom, this is not really...
<strong>Mom&gt;</strong>Hey young man! This is my house and I say what you can do and can&#39;t do. You do Open Source, but in my way! Nokia way!
</blockquote></p>

<p>The email was the <em>3rd</em> or so in which <a href="http://www.symbian.org/">Symbian Foundation</a> guys apologize about something that doesn&#39;t work or is missing from the website. Sometimes is the login, sometimes is the registration, sometimes is Mercurial...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll never forget how many time I repeated to all the folks in Symbian (while the <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> &quot;Open Sourcing Plan&quot; was rolled out): «<em>Saying you are <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a>, doesn&#39;t make you so. You need to know HOW to be Open Source: just giving the code could be not enough»</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I know this post is going to &quot;piss off&quot; a lot of guys in (and out) the Foundation, but... this is another part of being Open Source: understand critics, learn from them and get better at what you do. ;-) </p>
