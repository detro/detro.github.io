<p>This morning, while I was reading the <a href="http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/">Daniele Luttazzi&#39;s blog</a> and his series of post called <strong>&quot;La Palestra&quot;</strong> (<strong>&quot;The Gym&quot;</strong> in English), I decided that was worth it to translate some of the best I read.
&quot;The Gym&quot;? <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniele_Luttazzi">Luttazzi</a> publishes satyric jokes on his blog, from a collection of ones that he receives from his fans.
But why? Because I think some of them are good even in English. Italian&#39;s latest events are being publicized on international newspapers lately. This makes it possible to get those jokes.</p>

<p>There you go!
