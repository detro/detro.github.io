<p>In english:
<blockquote>The Tuscan city of Lucca has imposed a ban upon foreign eateries in its historic centre, in a move described by critics as racism. The city council voted to deny new licences to bars or restaurants with a ‘non-Italian style of cooking’ within the boundary of the Renaissance walls circling the city centre.</p>

<p>Tuscany&#39;s centre-left regional government warned against discriminatory measures &quot;introducing hidden forms of &#39;gastronomic or culinary&#39; racism.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The defence of quality is one thing, discrimination is another,&quot; said Paolo Cocchi, the regional councillor for commerce.</p>

<p>Lucca&#39;s town hall defended the new rules, saying they were meant to safeguard the city&#39;s cultural identity and that they were also applicable to sex shops, fast food restaurants and take-away pizza parlours. &quot;The ban targets McDonald&#39;s as much as kebab restaurants,&quot; said a spokesman.</p>

<p>The spokesman also said that the four kebab shops already in the city centre would be allowed to continue operating as normal, while, “as an invitation, not an order&quot;, all foreign restaurants in the city will be encouraged to include at least one typical dish from the region.</p>
