<div class="post">
<p>I would like to post some of the Brain Teaser (mostly algorithmic problems) I&#39;m giving to interviewee lately, and of course some that were submitted to me in the past.
But I can&#39;t promise I will keep doing it regularly: just that I will try (blogging regularly is hard for me).</p>

<p>The solution will be at the end of the post, just in case you would like to try to solve it first.
Of course my solution it&#39;s MY solution: it could be buggy or non-optimal. In those cases, PLEASE share your view and, better, your alternative solutions.</p>

<h3>Problem description</h3>

<p>Determine the first non-repeated character in a word. For example, in abbcaf it should return c. <strong>Do this in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O(n)</a> time with O(1) space</strong>.</p>

<h3>Some observation</h3>

<p><strong>O(n)</strong> means that the complexity of time of the algorithm must grow linearly with the input. So, if in this case the input is an <code>array of characters</code>, <em>an acceptable solution can contain &gt;1 non-nested FOR cycle</em>.</p>

<p><strong>O(1)</strong> means that the complexity of space of the algorithm must be constant, regardlessly of the input.</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>

<p>For simplicity, will assume that:
<ul>
<li>the input is always a lowercase string (enforcing this condition is easy and cheap)</li>
<li>the input is made made only of the letters of the english alphabet</li>
</ul>
Those conditions will then become the &quot;base&quot; of our solution.</p>

<p>Of course, you are free to assume more conditions: it&#39;s usually a good way to solve problems to start adding conditions that simplify the search of a solution, and then start a process of subtraction to arrive to have as less conditions as possible. It usually works for me.

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>[code lang=&quot;c&quot;]</p>

<h1>define NORMALIZE_CHAR(C)       (C-&#39;a&#39;)</h1>

<h1>include <stdio .h></h1>

<p>int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    char* input;
    unsigned int input_length;
    unsigned int i;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">unsigned int present_once = 0;
unsigned int present_multiple = 0;

const unsigned int char_to_bit[26] = {
   0x1, 0x2, 0x4, 0x8, // a, b, c, d
   0x10, 0x20, 0x40, 0x80, // ...
   0x100, 0x200, 0x400, 0x800,
   0x1000, 0x2000, 0x4000, 0x8000,
   0x10000, 0x20000, 0x40000, 0x80000, //...
   0x100000, 0x200000, 0x400000, 0x800000, // u, v, w, x
   0x1000000, 0x2000000 // y, z
   };

// Check the Input
if ( argc == 2 ) input = argv[1];
else return (1);

// Search for every character &quot;present only once&quot;
for ( i = 0; ; ++i )
{
    if ( input[i] != &#39;\0&#39; ) ///&lt; Doesn&#39;t use &quot;strlen&quot; - It checks at every iteration if we reached the end of the string
    {
        // If the current char is not already marked as &quot;present multiple times&quot;
        if ( !( present_multiple &amp; char_to_bit[ NORMALIZE_CHAR(input[i]) ] ) )
        {
            // It it is already marked as &quot;present once&quot;
            if ( present_once &amp; char_to_bit[ NORMALIZE_CHAR(input[i]) ] )
            {
                // Then mark it as &quot;present multiple times&quot; and unmark it&#39;s &quot;present once&quot;
                present_multiple |= char_to_bit[ NORMALIZE_CHAR(input[i]) ];
                present_once &amp;= ~char_to_bit[ NORMALIZE_CHAR(input[i]) ];
            }
            else
            {
                // Otherwise, mark it as &quot;present once&quot;
                present_once |= char_to_bit[ NORMALIZE_CHAR(input[i]) ];
            }
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // Store the input length to make next iteration easier
        input_length = i;
        break;
    }
}

// Look for the first char that is marked as &quot;present only once&quot; =&gt; that&#39;s the solution
for ( i = 0; i &lt; input_length; ++i )
{
    if ( present_once &amp; char_to_bit[ NORMALIZE_CHAR(input[i]) ] )
    {
        printf(&quot;=== FINAL RESULT: %c ===\n&quot;, input[i]);
        return (0);
    }
}
printf(&quot;=== FINAL RESULT: no char appears only once ===\n&quot;, input[i]);
return (0);

[/code]</p>

<p>The solution is built around the fact that 2 integers, <code>present<em>once</code> and <code>present</em>multiple</code> is used to memorize which letter of the alphabet appears only once, and which one appears more then once.
The result of this analysis occupies <strong>the space of just 2 <code>unsigned int</code></strong>: a second analysis of the string is then done to catch the first letter in it that is already known for being present only once.</p>

<h3>Final observations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Works as long as the set of chars is &lt; number_of_bits(int): that's why I limit it to the english alphabet - generally a <code>u_int</code> is made of <code>32 bits</code> on modern architectures.</li>
<li>In case you didn't get how does it work, the output is reconstructed from an Hexadecimal value where the result is the first bit (from right to left) set to "1"</li>
<li>It avoids to use of strlen to calculates the length of the input. This makes the solution a "2 * O(n) == O(n)" =&gt; <strong>VERY COOL</strong></li>
<li>The space occupied is "O(1)" (constant):; 1 pointer, 2 support u_int, 2 solution-carrying u_int, 1 hashmap of SIZE_OF_ALPHABET integers</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s all folks!</stdio></p>
