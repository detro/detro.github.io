This page is a "hub" for old university projects that, for sentimental attachment, I don't want to bin. Here is a list with a short description and a link to get more information, in case you find yourself interested.

## JPound
JPoundis a <em>Control and Configuration System</em> for <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/" target="_blank">Asterisk PBX</a>
Based on the <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/index.php?page=Asterisk+RealTime" target="_blank">ARA (Asterisk Realtime Architecture)</a> and builded with DB-Centric-Systems in mind, JPound is a young but powerful (I hope ;)) idea to make Asterisk a complete, manageable, extensible, flexible Phone System. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jpound/" target="_blank">Link</a>.

## JAEBI
J2EE + SOAP + WSDL Framework for generic Client-Server communication based on Web Services. The proof-of-concept covered three kind of clients: J2ME Device, Desktop App and Web App. <a href="http://cdn.ivandemarino.me/oldprojects/JAEBI/index.html">Link</a> (in Italian).

## MGS - Multithreaded Game Server
C++ Multi-Threaded Game Server that allowed generic types of multi-user virtual-room based games. The provided client was plain Telnet: the whole communication was based on sockets, with an _home-made_ protocol. <a href="http://cdn.ivandemarino.me/oldprojects/MGS/index.html">Link</a>.

## PSH - Patty SHell
The project consisted of the implementation of a Unix Shell in ANSI C using ONLY POSIX System Calls. <a href="http://cdn.ivandemarino.me/oldprojects/PSH/index.html">Link</a>.

## Essay: VLAN
This was more a "documentary" project. The essay describes what VLAN are, how are they normally implemented (down to the `bits`), the protocol used by _standard_ and _proprietary_ VLAN and some usage examples. <a href="http://cdn.ivandemarino.me/oldprojects/tesina_vlan/html/tesina_vlan.html">Link</a> ([PDF](http://cdn.ivandemarino.me/oldprojects/tesina_vlan/tesina_vlan.pdf)) ([HTML Zip](http://cdn.ivandemarino.me/oldprojects/tesina_vlan/tesina_vlan-html.zip)) (all links are in Italian).
