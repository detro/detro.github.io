I love what I do. Computer Science, Software Development and relata are integral part of my daily life. I have different projects (mostly _mini_ projects) going on: sometimes I am relentless.

## Open Source stuff
In the last two years I started to host [my projects on GitHub](https://github.com/detro): it's fast, it's simple, it a great free service and, very important, it's based on [mighty Git](http://git-scm.com/).

### My code on GitHub
<div id="github-badge"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
  GITHUB_USERNAME="detro";
  GITHUB_HEAD="div";
  GITHUB_THEME="white";
  GITHUB_TITLE = "A brief view of my current projects on GitHub";
  GITHUB_SHOW_ALL = "Show all";
</script>
<script src="http://drnic.github.com/github-badges/dist/github-badge-launcher.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

## Non Open Source stuff
I'm a strong supporter of Open Source: both as a way of doing stuff, and as a principle in itself. But there is also some stuff that I like to keep closed (for now at least).

Take a look to this page child pages for more info.

## Old University stuff
In addition, there are some older projects that I developed during university. They are mostly low-quality code, but at that time they made me get some very good scores :).

I have a "personal attachment" to them, and I didn't want to toss it. You can find them under [/Projects/Old Projects](/Projects/Old-projects).
