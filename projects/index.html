                <p>I love what I do. Computer Science, Software Development and relata are integral part of my daily life. I have different projects (mostly <em>mini</em> projects) going on: sometimes I am relentless.</p>

<h2>Open Source stuff</h2>

<p>In the last two years I started to host <a href="https://github.com/detro">my projects on GitHub</a>: it&#39;s fast, it&#39;s simple, it a great free service and, very important, it&#39;s based on <a href="http://git-scm.com/">mighty Git</a>.</p>

<h3>My code on GitHub</h3>

<div id="github-badge"></div>

<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
  GITHUB_USERNAME="detro";
  GITHUB_HEAD="div";
  GITHUB_THEME="white";
  GITHUB_TITLE = "A brief view of my current projects on GitHub";
  GITHUB_SHOW_ALL = "Show all";
</script>

<script src="http://drnic.github.com/github-badges/dist/github-badge-launcher.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<h2>Non Open Source stuff</h2>

<p>I&#39;m a strong supporter of Open Source: both as a way of doing stuff, and as a principle in itself. But there is also some stuff that I like to keep closed (for now at least).</p>

<p>Take a look to this page child pages for more info.</p>

<h2>Old University stuff</h2>

<p>In addition, there are some older projects that I developed during university. They are mostly low-quality code, but at that time they made me get some very good scores :).</p>

<p>I have a &quot;personal attachment&quot; to them, and I didn&#39;t want to toss it. You can find them under <a href="/Projects/Old-projects">/Projects/Old Projects</a>.</p>
