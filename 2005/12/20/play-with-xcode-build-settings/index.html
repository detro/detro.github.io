<blockquote>In order to become an effective Xcode user, you need to understand two major Xcode concepts. The first is how Xcode projects are defined and organized. The second is how the Xcode build system takes the targets that are defined in your projects and turns them into products.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>There is a lot of flexibility in the Xcode build system for customization, so you can choose to keep your settings simple or make them as complex as you like. But for most purposes, a basic understanding of how build settings and build configurations work will make this topic easy to masterâ€”once you have these concepts clear, you can choose the settings that work best for you.</blockquote>
