                <h2>Luigi Tenco's changing hope</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Dec 2005</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Grillo talks about a mail that a good friend of Luigi Tenco, Gino Paoli, sends to it. In the mail Paoli talks about:
<blockquote>... Another journalist who wants to ask me about Luigi.
But I believe that a friend should leave him in peace.</p>

<p>They say that things about his death are not clear, but who is it that has so much interest in knowing the truth?</p>

<p>Journalists? Finally they&#39;ll write their own piece. They&#39;ll have the article on the front page.</p>

<p>The magistrate? He too will have some exposure.</p>

<p>Friends that knew him? The true friends stay silent and don&#39;t try to profit by going to the TV or the newspapers....</blockquote></p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m <strong>really demotivated and sad</strong> about the Italy status: no justice, no democracy, no information&#39;s freedom. And it&#39;s very meaningful that the right reasoning comes from persons like Grillo, a comedian.</p>

<p>I hope a day &quot;<em>... it’ll change you’ll see...</em>&quot;, but Italy it&#39;s a &quot;politically and democratically&quot; devasted country right now.
Every media, every &quot;information channel&quot; check and filter his message with the only target of <strong>CONTROL PEOPLE</strong>.</p>

<p>Only persons like Grillo say the right thing: <strong>inquire by yuorself</strong>, s<strong>earch for information on the WWW internet</strong>, <strong>read newspapers of other country</strong>. Only in that way you can KNOW THE TRUTH.</p>
