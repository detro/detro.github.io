Only because it&#39;s necessary for <strong>security reasons</strong>: I&#39;m very tyred to these annoying practies... ;)
<blockquote>
<h3>2.0.2 Security Release</h3>
An important security issue has been brought to the attention of the WordPress team and we have worked diligently to bring you a new stable release that addresses it. Our <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">latest version 2.0.2</a> contains several bugfixes and security fixes.</p>

<p>The problems addressed are unannounced XSS issues privately discovered and reported to the WordPress team. Thanks to Mark Jaquith, Robert Deaton, and David House for assisting with this release.</p>

<p>Just a quick note: this is different than the snake-oil reports that went out on some security lists a few days ago. There were a couple, but they were either not actual security problems, too small to warrant a release, or just patently false. Remember: just because you read it on a mailing list doesn’t mean that it’s true. We’d be the first people to panic if there was an actual problem.</p>

<p>As always, when something serious crosses our desks we jump on it and get a well-tested release out as soon as possible.
