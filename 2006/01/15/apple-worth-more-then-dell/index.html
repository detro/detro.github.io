<p>In August 2005 I was thinking about purchasing Apple quotes: $43/45 was a good price for my wallett ;) .</p>

<p>My Bank, instead, wants from me &quot;things that I don&#39;t have&quot; (other moneys) to allow me to operate on the US market.</p>

<p>Today is a good day but, if I had purchased some Apple quotes at that time, now I would be rich :cry: .

<p>The title?
See at <a target="_new" href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/8206/">here</a> for comparation between Apple and Dell on US market.
<blockquote>On October 6, 1997, in response to the question of what he&#39;d do if he was in charge of <a target="_new" href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> Computer, <a target="_new" href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a> founder and then CEO Michael Dell stood before a crowd of several thousand IT executives and answered flippantly, &quot;What would I do? I&#39;d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.&quot;</p>

<p>A little more than a month later, on November 10, 1997, <a target="_new" href="http://www.pelagius.com/AppleRecon/971111_report.html">new Apple iCEO Steve Jobs responded</a>, speaking in front of an image of Michael Dell&#39;s bulls-eye covered face, &quot;We&#39;re coming after you, you&#39;re in our sights.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, after a little more than eight years of hard work, Apple Computer, Inc. passed Dell, Inc. in market value. That&#39;s right, at market close <a target="_new" href="http://quotes.nasdaq.com/Quote.dll?symbol=AAPL&symbol=dell&mode=stock&multi.x=26&multi.y=4">Apple Computer ($72,132,428,843) is now worth more than Dell ($71,970,702,760)</a>.</p>

<p>Got any snappy retorts for that one, Mr. Dell?</p>

<p>Luckily, Apple has had the right man in charge since July 1997; a man with the vision and the ability to do what lesser men think impossible.</blockquote></p>
