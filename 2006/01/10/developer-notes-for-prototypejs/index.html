Today, with my friend and co-worked Sbatman, we were trying to understand how the famous <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/" target="_new">prototype.js</a> library works.</p>

<p>For not-Ajax developer: <blockquote>Prototype is a JavaScript framework that aims to ease development of dynamic web applications. Featuring a unique, easy-to-use toolkit for class-driven development and the nicest Ajax library around, Prototype is quickly becoming the codebase of choice for Web 2.0 developers everywhere.</blockquote></p>

<p>After an afternoon without appreciable results ( :cry: ), Sbatman found that documentation online: <a target="_new" href="http://www.sergiopereira.com/articles/prototype.js.html">Developer Notes for prototype.js</a>.
<blockquote>What is it?
In case you haven&#39;t already used it, <a target="_new" href="http://prototype.conio.net/">prototype.js</a> is a JavaScript library written by <a href="http://www.conio.net/" target="_new">Sam Stephenson</a>. This amazingly well thought and well written piece of standards-compliant code takes a lot of the burden associated with creating rich, highly interactive web pages that characterize the Web 2.0 off your back.</p>

<p>If you tried to use this library recently, you probably noticed that documentation is not one of its strongest points. As many other developers before me, I got my head around prototype.js by reading the source code and experimenting with it. I thought it would be nice to take notes while I learned and share with everybody else. </blockquote></p>
