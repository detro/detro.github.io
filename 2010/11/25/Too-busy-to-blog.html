<p>Yes, <a href="http://twitter.com/detronizator">Twitter</a>. I do believe now that is what stops me from writing a post: <strong>sometimes thoughts are not worth more than a 140 characters</strong>. And the very nature of Twitter also pushes me to be as synthetic as possible. With the result that I don’t really post anything anymore. :-(</p>

<p>Is all this twittering killing my Blogging? One thing I know, it managed to practically kill my Feeds subscription: I don’t subscribe to blogs anymore. I just follow on twitter who I really think is an interesting person, and they just <em>throw</em> good stuff at me. My <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> is ALWAYS overloaded!</p>

<p>But I do have some stuff stuck in my head that I want to do. Stuff like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new REALLY NICE theme for <a href="github.com/detro/bloggart">Bloggart</a>, that I’m going to use here - of course, based on <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a></li>
  <li>I want to solve (and publish the solution) for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php">Facebook Puzzles</a></li>
  <li>I want to give a go at <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS">UglifyJS</a>, hopefully before gets uncool</li>
  <li>Since <a href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2010/11/15/Full-Frontal-2010---My-transcript">Full Frontal 2010</a>, and particularly thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/seb_ly">Seb Lee-Delise</a> presentation, I want to get into this HTML5 Canvas crazy-ness, maybe trying out <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a></li>
  <li>Also, I want to port <a href="https://github.com/kamicane/slickspeed/">SlickSpeed CSS Selectors Speed Test</a> to Google App Engine</li>
  <li>And last, but not least, I want to write a small Google App Engine template to help people turn App Engine into their personal, free CDN</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will I ever find the time to do all that?</strong></p>

<p>Oh yes, I forgot to tell you: I just got <a href="http://assassinscreed.uk.ubi.com/brotherhood/">Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood</a>. And that DEFINITELY doesn’t help ;-)</p>
