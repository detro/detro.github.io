        <p>A lot is changing in my life. I&#39;m getting older, I&#39;m getting wiser, I&#39;m getting &quot;stupider&quot; (like it was even possible :-P ).</p>

<h3>New Job</h3>

<p>Last Friday (<time datetime="2010-09-03">3rd of Sep 2010</time>) I left <a href="http://www.orange.com/en_EN/group/global_footprint/countries/uk/uk-lab.jsp">Orange</a> <a href="http://orangelabsuk.com/">Labs UK</a>. After 2 years and 2 months, my work at this the UK branch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_T%C3%A9l%C3%A9com">France Telecom</a> R&amp;D is over.</p>

<p>I have been involved in a number of projects with various degrees of commitment: some full time, some to land a hand, some to just criticise and make fun of colleagues (just kidding: it was more like trying to shutdown wasteful project branching and focusing on the good targets :-P ).</p>

<p>I had the possibility to work on multiple platforms, technologies, layers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI Stack</a>. This made it possible to mix and match a lot of technologies. And that was fun!</p>

<p>To people that asked <em>what I was</em>, I always defined myself as <strong>&quot;Mobile and Web Software Engineer&quot;</strong>: I think it synthesised well what was my expertise area. Something that fitted well was also <strong>&quot;C++ Developer with a thing for Web technologies&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll miss the Lab (or, better, some people in it): in 2 years a lot of connections have been created. Some flourished into <em>friendship</em>. Some into a really solid <em>respect</em> and <em>admiration</em>. I hope is reciprocal.</p>

<p>What happened then? Well, I realised that the part about <strong>&quot;... a thing for Web technologies&quot;</strong> is the most important for me. The one that brings the most of the fun.</p>

<p>Then, a good friend of mine, <a href="http://wtb-blog.heroku.com/">John Bower</a>, that just moved to splendid <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=mexico+city">Mexico City</a>, said that his (ex)employer, <a href="http://www.betfair.com/">Betfair.com</a>, was looking for Front-End Web Developers. He insisted for me to try to get the job: it&#39;s true that I&#39;ve been focusing on Mobile for the last &gt;3 years, but I should give it a go anyway. What was the worst that could have happened?</p>

<p>Well, long story cut short, now I&#39;m a Betfair employee. I&#39;m eager to do my part in one of the biggest transactional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">webapp</a> in the world:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Across all its products, Betfair processes more than 6 million transactions on an average day - more than all the European stock exchanges combined. It is a two-time winner of the Queen&#39;s Award for Enterprise - the only betting company in the world ever to achieve this level of recognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>No</strong>, I&#39;m not turning into a gambler. I&#39;m not into gambling at all. What is really fascinating, is the challenge that this service faces every day. And I&#39;m eager to be part of something this big and with this demanding level of quality.</p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>, you will see much more web stuff on this blog from now on.</p>

<p>Oh yes, what about this blog?</p>

<h3>New Blog</h3>

<p>I already wrote about this new blog in <a href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2010/08/30/Hello-World-again">this older post</a>. I decided that I wanted to change hosting and technology, and have a blog that I run myself. A blog where the code base is small enough that I can actually implement functionalities that I need myself.</p>

<p>Plus, I wanted to learn more about <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google Appengine</a>: the work on the <a href="http://www.txty.mobi">txty.mobi</a> webapp made me love it - now I want to really become an expert. When I started to look at <a href="http://github.com/Arachnid/bloggart">Nick Johnson&#39;s Bloggart</a>, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still working on a (decently) smooth transition from <strong>www.detronizator.org</strong>, and there is lot still to add (i.e. the concept of &quot;static pages&quot; - bloggart is built mainly around the concept &quot;posts&quot;), but most of the ground is covered. The biggest part, migrating &gt;6 years worth of Blogging, is done and fully imported (I&#39;ll write about that in a series of posts I&#39;m preparing).</p>

<p>Theme wise I&#39;ll stick with <a href="http://github.com/Arachnid/bloggart/tree/master/themes/default/">Nick&#39;s default theme</a> for now: later on I&#39;ll work on a new, personal theme.</p>

<p>So, go ahead and subscribe to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BlogIvanDeMarino">my atom feed</a>. For the &quot;early adopters&quot;, I also have my feed published on the <a href="https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/subscribe">pubsubhubbub</a> server. How cool is that! ;-)</p>

<h3>New Life(?)</h3>

<p>Maybe. Stuff have changed, and is still changing. People that once were important and focal, are now fading away. I guess it&#39;s how things work when you grow and your &quot;mental paths&quot; and &quot;desires&quot; don&#39;t match anymore. Too much has been tried to &quot;make it work&quot;: I think now we miss the will to stretch a bit more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very sad, but also teaches that nothing is forever. At least, if both parties don&#39;t want it at the same extent.</p>

<p>But there are also things that are changing for the better. It&#39;s now a year that I share my house with my soul mate, and has been quite a year. I don&#39;t think I could ask for anything better on that side. I know, I got lucky: she still didn&#39;t understand what a mistake she is making ;-) . Given my past in Italy, and all the bad (and worse) things I had to go through, I think I&#39;m happy now. I hope I deserve it, and that my luck lasts enough to cover bad memories with much better ones.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you can name it &quot;a new life&quot;. For sure it&#39;s quite a collection of changes for me.</p>

<p>Stay tuned. My <strong>&quot;online ranting&quot;</strong> is far from being over.</p>
