        <p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> Come back to God. You are still on time to get baptised. You can save your childrens: baptise them! God will have mercy of their souls and allow them to the Heaven!</p>

<p>me&gt; Excuse me, what are you doing?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> I&#39;m spreading the world of Christ!</p>

<p>me&gt; Christ?!?! That is great!</p>

</div>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> Yes, I know. Thanks.</p>

<p>me&gt; So, he told you about that?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> Who? About what?</p>

<p>me&gt; Christ. You said you are spreading his word.</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> Yes, He told me. Lord spoke to me!</p>

<p>me&gt; That is just plain cool. How did he do that? Did he appear to you? He brought you to the 7th sky? How? Tell me.</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> What are you talking about?!?!</p>

<p>me&gt; I&#39;m asking, how did he told you those things?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> He didn&#39;t &quot;talked to me&quot;... in that sense...</p>

<p>me&gt; So he didn&#39;t tell you this stuff?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> He did! He just didn&#39;t do it in person!</p>

<p>me&gt; So how? IM? Twitter? Facebook?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> What?</p>

<p>me&gt; Instant Messaging? You know... ICQ, Gtalk, jabber. How?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> Dear you. What have Satan done to your soul and mind!??!</p>

<p>me&gt; OK, I&#39;m a bit of a geek, yes. But I&#39;m just asking how Christ did actually spoke to you.</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> He didn&#39;t. He passed me his message through his Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>me&gt; So, he come as a Holy Spirit? Or a Holy Spirit came to you?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> No, the Holy Sprit just caught me and &quot;Enlightened&quot; me.</p>

<p>me&gt; So, he just turned on the light? And you got that you had to go around and tell people to get Baptised?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> No. Not that &quot;Enlightening&quot;. He brought light to my soul, making me understand that I had a mission: to spread His word.</p>

<p>me&gt; Over LIGHT? Jesus is using photon-based communication networks? Fiber optics?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> My dear! No, Jesus&#39;s Holy Spirit did it all.</p>

<p>me&gt; Ah. And how did it was? What color? What shape? Were you able to touch it? Or was more like an hologram or something?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> An holo-what? What the hell are you saying?!?!</p>

<p>me&gt; I&#39;m just trying to understand over which Media Jesus told you to come here and do what you are doing.</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> Look. Reverend <em>[name of a Reverend]</em> told me to come here and praise the Lord. I&#39;m doing this to save Your Souls.</p>

<p>me&gt; From what?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> From the Evil!</p>

<p>me&gt; What Evil?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> This Evil! The society! The people all around us!</p>

<p>me&gt; So, you are saying that People are Evil?!?!? All of us?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> No, I&#39;m saying that You are without God. And that is Evil.</p>

<p>me&gt; So, you are saying I&#39;m without God! So, I&#39;m Evil.</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> Yes!</p>

<p>me&gt; How do you know that? God told you that I&#39;m Evil? And if I&#39;m Evil, why does God wants me to have it? I mean, I&#39;m the exact opposite of it. Wouldn&#39;t this union of God and Evil make the Void?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> What? What are you saying? I don&#39;t understand!... Look, kid, are you without God?</p>

<p>me&gt; I don&#39;t know. Do you?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> No.</p>

<p>me&gt; So, you don&#39;t know if here there are believers or not?</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> No. Actually,... no.</p>

<p>me&gt; And you are here praising the Lord and saying that we should be baptised.</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> Yes.</p>

<p>me&gt; And you don&#39;t know if, for example, we already are. Or if, for example, I&#39;m Indu, or Italian, or Egyptian, or Hungarian, or Brazilian. And, by any chance, we believe in other Gods. Or if we are, by any chance, THE Evil.</p>

<p><strong>cs&gt;</strong> No. I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>me&gt; So, if you don&#39;t know anything. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HERE YELLING AT US!?!?! Mind your own Belief!!!</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong> Sorry, I don&#39;t mean to be offensive against any Religion or Belief. I just want to share that I hate when people yell &quot;the word of Lord&quot; at us, without knowing who the hell we are. Religion should be kept in religious places: others beliefs (and, most important for an atheist like me, <strong>disbeliefs</strong>) should be respected.</p>
