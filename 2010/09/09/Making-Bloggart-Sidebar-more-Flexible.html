Nice Branching Metaphor
</div>
<p><br />
In fact, at <a href="http://github.com/detro/bloggart">github.com/detro/bloggart</a> you can find <strong>my branch</strong> of Bloggart, where I’m gradually pushing the new functionality I want/need.</p>

<p>I just pushed a commit that changes how the Sidebar is configured: no more just a bunch of links and no more than that. You can now configure your sidebar with 4 types of blocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Links</li>
  <li>Twitter widget</li>
  <li>Google Friend Connect widget</li>
  <li>Generic HTML Code Block</li>
</ul>

<p>Every one of those blocks has generic and specific options, to tune it the way you want. I think is making it much more flexible.</p>

<p>Enough talking: if you are interested, you will probably find more useful to take a look the <a href="http://github.com/detro/bloggart/commit/5e59541483d7732f31aa505f849e3965b64b156d">the actual commit</a>.</p>

<p>Have fun.</p>
