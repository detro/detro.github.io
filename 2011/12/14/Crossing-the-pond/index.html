<p class="meta">13 Dec 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I borrowed the title from <a href="http://ariya.ofilabs.com/">a guy</a> who kickstarted all of this. <em>Thanks Ariya ;)</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m leaving <a href="http://www.betfair.com">Betfair</a>. I owe a lot to this company: for a bit longer than a year I have had the pleasure to work with smart, enlightened, knowledgeable people from which I learned loads. Leaving was definitely not an easy choice.</p>

<p>The only thing didn&#39;t happen, is that I didn&#39;t become a proper <em>punter</em>: I just learned that even something sounding &quot;boring&quot; as betting on sports, can actually be a very big challenge in terms of the technologies involved. Even more, if you try to do it in the <em>Betfair way</em>: with million of customers, all constantly hammering the servers to make the most out of their money.</p>

<h2>Where am I going?</h2>

<p>On January I&#39;ll be joining <a href="http://www.neustar.biz/">Neustar</a>, working with the <a href="http://www.webmetrics.com/">Webmetrics</a> team, based in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego">San Diego</a>.</p>

Google searches about San Diego return only this kind of picture ;)

<p>Webmetrics works in the business of Monitoring and Testing websites. It&#39;s a big player in this market and I&#39;m going to help on scaling their infrastructure to use the <strong>light-and-awesome</strong> <a href="http://www.phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ll try to add my bit to the already <a href="http://opensource.webmetrics.com/">remarkable amount of work they share with the Open Source community</a>: people like <a href="http://blog.lightbody.net/post/11867646583/where-the-heck-has-patrick-been">Patrick</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb0m2xxWEg8">Lightbody</a>, creator of <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> RC, works there!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be reporting to Simon Nicoud: folks that navigate the Web Velocity waters must remember him for his talks at <a href="http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011/public/schedule/speaker/18382">Velocity Conf</a>.</p>

<h2>I&#39;m not <em>exactly</em> moving to the USA</h2>

<p><strong>Love is a very important thing in Life</strong>, especially if you have found it. In the name of it, I decided to try to marry love-need with work-aspiration: I&#39;ll still be based in UK, but travel on a regular basis to USA. This will require me to become a very frequent flyer, and learn all the tricks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_lag#Management">jet lag management</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very excited about this: working in the USA, with USA folks is something I always wanted to experience. And now I finally can. Plus, I&#39;ll be working on technologies I&#39;m really into: what better can I ask for?</p>

<p>Plus, San Diego seems like a REALLY nice place to be. So, I&#39;m not going to miss the english weather. Right? ;)</p>

<p><em>See you downtown!</em></p>
