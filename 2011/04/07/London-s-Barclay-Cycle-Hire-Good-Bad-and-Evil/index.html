    <div class="post-body">
        <p>Last Sunday my girlfriend, my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/lucabox">@lucabox</a> and I decided have a go at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/14808.aspx">London&#39;s Barclays Cycle Hire</a>. Wanting to enjoy the weather in Hyde Park, we agreed at meeting there: Luca cycled from Tate Modern, we took our bike at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Queen&#x27;s+Gate,+Westminster,+London+SW7+2,+UK&amp;aq=&amp;sll=51.501854,-0.175036&amp;sspn=0.002454,0.004442&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Queen&#x27;s+Gate,+Westminster,+London+SW7+2,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">Hyde Park&#39;s Queen&#39;s Gate</a>.</p>

Boris and 'it's' bikes
</div>

<p>The day was great, and the good weather helped. The experience with those bikes was... follow me.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<h3>Cheap to start</h3>

<p>The price scheme is simple if you are not a member: we paid just £1.00 to access. The <strong>first 30 minutes are free</strong>, than <strong>£1 for the first hour</strong>, £4 for 1.5 hours and so growing. Details <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/14811.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe not cheap if you are a regular user, but cheap enough for occasional usage.</p>

<h3>Comfy</h3>

<p>The bike is really comfy. The <strong>sit is very wide</strong> and the position is straight, so that you don&#39;t get tired too quickly. </p>

<div class="img">
<img src="http://blog.evanscycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/barclays-cycle-hire-scheme-36.jpg" width="500" alt="VERY adjustable sit" />
VERY adjustable sit
</div>

<p>The <strong>sit is easy to adjust</strong>, and it has a lot of possible settings to suit every heights.</p>

<h3>Not for racing</h3>

<p>Of course, forget about going too fast: there are <strong>just 3 gears</strong>. The first 2 are quite &quot;light&quot;, while the third is only for sustained speeds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s designed for an easy, pleasant ride - and that is a good thing if you ask me. Generally londoners are always <em>on a rush</em> - sometimes for no reason.</p>

<h3>Smart-ass proof</h3>

<p>One of the members of the group (I won&#39;t tell who :-P) tried a trick: given that the price up to 1 hour is £1, instead of let the clock tick up to the second hour, he decided to try a trick: put back the bike and get a new one. In this way the second hour would still cost £1.</p>

<div class="img">

[Pantani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Pantani) is back
</div>

<p>Fortunately (I say) the scheme is smart-ass proof: <strong>when you put back a bike, you can&#39;t access any other for at least 5 minutes</strong>. <em>Gotcha!</em></p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<h3>Heavy</h3>

<p>The <strong>bike is pretty heavy</strong>. Again, the bike is not for racing, but it might result a bit <em>difficult to handle</em> for some people, given also that the breaks aren&#39;t that great. I&#39;m pretty strong, and still I had to push hard on the break stick to get the thing to stop.</p>

<h3>Docking station lock is too hard</h3>

<p>My girlfriend had some issues with the docking station lock: was a bit too hard to release or lock in. But I guess this is a trade off to make it solid and safe.</p>

<div class="img">

<h3>Too many &quot;defective&quot; bikes</h3>

<p>A lot of bikes, too many if you ask me, were in a <em>defective state</em>: they were in perfect conditions, but somehow the <strong>docking station thought they were defective</strong> and wouldn&#39;t release those.</p>

<p>Pretty annoying sometimes.</p>

<h3>Not very spread yet</h3>

<p>Unfortunately the Barclays Cycle Hire is not very evenly spread across London <strong>(yet?)</strong>. If you take a look to the <a href="https://web.barclayscyclehire.tfl.gov.uk/maps">official map</a>, and zoom out a bit, you will see that only Zone 1 is covered. <em>Come on Boris: let&#39;s put some more on the roads!</em></p>

<h2>The Evil</h2>

<h3>Unusable buttons at the docking station</h3>

<p>I didn&#39;t actually explain how you get a bike! Once at the station, you pay with your card and receive a receipt. On the receipt there is a code, a temporary code (that lasts 10 minutes only) of 5/6 digits, composed only of <code>1</code>s, <code>2</code>s or <code>3</code>s.</p>

<p>On the left side of every docked bike is this:
<div class="img">
<img src="http://www.roadcyclinguk.com/uploads/images/Large/9994.jpg" alt="authorisation code input buttons" />
authorisation code input buttons: pure evil!
</div>
this <em>keypad</em> is a made of 3 rubber digital buttons. They are difficult to push (very small) and give you <strong>NO FEEDBACK WHATSOEVER</strong>. Only once you have entered the code, the light turns <span style="color: red;">RED</span> or <span style="color: green;">GREEN</span> (the former if <span style="color: red;"><em>the code is wrong</em></span> or <span style="color: red;"><em>the bike is defective</em></span>, the latter if <span style="color: green;"><em>the bike has been released</em></span>).</p>

<p>The absence of any audio and/or physical feedback at every button push, and the fact that the buttons are almost flat it&#39;s just <strong>terrible</strong>. Did anyone actually do any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing">Usability Testing</a> on those things before putting it on the road?</p>

<p>Looks like it has been left as a <em>low priority task</em> to the engineers that were on the project. And you can clearly see the terrible results. <strong>Double thumbs down Boris!</strong></p>

<h3>No freaking Oyster Card? SERIOUSLY???</h3>

<p>OK, here I&#39;m really REALLY disappointed: Oyster Cards have been <em>pushed</em> on Londoners for years before becoming widely accepted. <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/termsandconditions/6014.aspx">Barclay itself made a special deal with TfL for an all-in-one card</a>. And now what they do? They force you to pay for those bikes:</p>

<ul>
<li>either using your credit card</li>
<li>or subscribing for a membership that will give you an electronic key</li>
</ul>

<p>What about Oysters? I understand that this service requires a full identification of the user, but the service could be easily restricted to <a href="https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/link/0004.do">registered Oysters only</a>. What is the reason for making people subscribe to a whole new thing? <strong>Nonsense if you ask me!</strong></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Well, regardless of the (major?) flaws of this scheme, I believe this is a good thing for London and londoners. It&#39;s just the beginning, and different aspects need to be tuned, but this can become a good service with time.</p>

<p><strong>Did you have a chance to give it a spin? What was your experience?</strong></p>
