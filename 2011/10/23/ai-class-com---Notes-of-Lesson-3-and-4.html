<meta name="description" content="This week the ai-class was about Probability, Bayes Networks and Inference. For people like me, that have to find patches of free time to study this course, there is a good news: you can do Homeworks 2 just by studying the first of the 2 lessons. This can help to prioritise your schedule, and study the second lesson (that focuses on the “computation” over Bayes Networks) with a little bit more peace of mind. This guy was great at inference ;-) Of course, I’m assuming you are doing the Advanced Track, where there are deadlines. I have here my notes of the 2 classes: 3. Probability in AI 4. Probabilistic Inference The second notes about “Inference” are still a work in progress, as I completed only half of the videos so far. Will try to finish it before Monday. Now it’s time for some mussles. UPDATE 1: I have been asked for the notes of my Homework 1. Here you go. But bear in mind: given those are homework, I didn’t put in them proper explanation. I suggest you watch the videos for that. ;-) UPDATE 2: I’m done with notes of Lesson 4, “Probabilistic Inference”. Prof. Norvig concludes the lesson presenting the Monty Hall Problem: a very interesting one! If you want my explanation of the Monty Hall problem, check out my notes. I think I did a decent job at explaining it." />

<p>For people like me, that have to find <em>patches of free time</em> to study this course, there is a good news: you can do <strong>Homeworks 2</strong> just by studying the first of the 2 lessons. This can help to prioritise your schedule, and study the second lesson (that focuses on the “computation” over Bayes Networks) with a little bit more peace of mind.</p>

This guy was great at inference ;-)

<p>Of course, I’m assuming you are doing the Advanced Track, where there are deadlines.</p>

<p>I have here my notes of the 2 classes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/3f520502-9119-460a-bac6-1760fb0f0a72/4913d7d005608b878aed8fe1c8f20a3b">3. Probability in AI</a></li>

</ul>

<p><del>The second notes about “Inference” are still a <strong>work in progress</strong>, as I completed only half of the videos so far. Will try to finish it before Monday.</del></p>

<p>Now it’s time for some <a href="http://www.brouge.co.uk/Rich_Map_Page.html">mussles</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: I have been asked for the notes of my Homework 1. <a href="http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/d0ca9568-799d-4efe-82a1-817882ff4581/2964f322bc4072aad30b35ca3d9e3b6b">Here you go</a>. But bear in mind: given those are homework, I didn’t put in them proper explanation. I suggest you watch the videos for that. ;-)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: I’m done with notes of Lesson 4, “Probabilistic Inference”. Prof. Norvig concludes the lesson presenting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall Problem</a>: a very interesting one! If you want my explanation of the Monty Hall problem, check out <a href="http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/cda9eda7-b825-44ff-91b4-48626891cd3e/933cf74b53520f73adf4c68113d59931">my notes</a>. I think I did a <em>decent</em> job at explaining it.</p>
