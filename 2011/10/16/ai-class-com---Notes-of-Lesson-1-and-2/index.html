<div class="post">
<p>Recently the online class &quot;<a href="https://www.ai-class.com/">Introduction to Artificial Intelligente</a>&quot; has began. <a href="https://www.ai-class.com/">Prof. Sebastian Thrun</a> and <a href="http://norvig.com/">Prof. Peter Norvig</a>, from <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, are offering it for free. And I&#39;m enjoying every minute of it.</p>

<p>The idea is to trasport to the web <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/">the same course that they are teaching in person at Stanford</a>. Almost simultaneously.</p>

One of the great notes from [larvecode](http://larvecode.tumblr.com/tagged/ai-class).

<p>It&#39;s in my opinion a <strong>great experiment</strong>: there are <strong>160,000 students</strong>, and will be interesting to see how it pans out. The two profs are doing their best to <em>&quot;leverage the scalability of the web&quot;</em>, instead of trying to retrofit the web into the class. That is smart. And gives them more chances of success.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you are interested to know more, I gave you the links above. Check it out if you are into this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>Here I only want to signal a couple of links I&#39;m sharing: my notes for <a href="http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/5a5f0750-5afd-4aa8-89b3-f1415dee4d00/a5ba70b87bcaee6cddb409632a9bba4d">Lesson 1</a> and <a href="http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/42ff5536-31af-4dd0-a0e8-7d17e38b62f1/d89e4cbd0fd75ba1ace59cab1a3b7182">Lesson 2</a>. I&#39;m using <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> to take the notes, and that makes it really easy to share. I also have notes with my solution of the first Homework assignment... but I have to hold on to that, as the <a href="http://institutionalcompliance.stanford.edu/conduct/">Stanford Code of Conduct</a> requires me to wait for the profs to publish the solutions first (that will happen this Sunday 16th of Ocober at 23:59 UTC).</p>

<p>In my notes I also imported some of <a href="http://larvecode.tumblr.com/tagged/ai-class">the great notes/pictures/drawing from larvecode</a>. Very cool stuff!</p>
