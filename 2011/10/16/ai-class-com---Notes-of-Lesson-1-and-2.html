<meta name="description" content="Recently the online class “Introduction to Artificial Intelligente” has began. Prof. Sebastian Thrun and Prof. Peter Norvig, from Stanford University, are offering it for free. And I’m enjoying every minute of it. The idea is to trasport to the web the same course that they are teaching in person at Stanford. Almost simultaneously. &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/11396980511/2/tumblr_lt0ha3ToqC1r22978&quot; &quot;Intelligent Agent&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt; One of the great notes from [larvecode](http://larvecode.tumblr.com/tagged/ai-class). It’s in my opinion a great experiment: there are 160,000 students, and will be interesting to see how it pans out. The two profs are doing their best to “leverage the scalability of the web”, instead of trying to retrofit the web into the class. That is smart. And gives them more chances of success. Anyway, if you are interested to know more, I gave you the links above. Check it out if you are into this kind of stuff. Here I only want to signal a couple of links I’m sharing: my notes for Lesson 1 and Lesson 2. I’m using Evernote to take the notes, and that makes it really easy to share. I also have notes with my solution of the first Homework assignment… but I have to hold on to that, as the Stanford Code of Conduct requires me to wait for the profs to publish the solutions first (that will happen this Sunday 16th of Ocober at 23:59 UTC). In my notes I also imported some of the great notes/pictures/drawing from larvecode. Very cool stuff!" />
