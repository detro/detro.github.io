<div class="post">
<p>Today I got a nice surprise in the post at work: my &quot;Tote Lounger&quot; had arrived. Few months ago I decided to contribute to a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diatom/sketchchair-furniture-designed-by-you">Kickstarter Project by 2 friends of mine: SketchChair</a>.</p>

<p>The two guys are Greg and Tiago, and they run Diatom Studio. Here is a quote from <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/diatom/sketchchair-furniture-designed-by-you">their Kickstarter page</a>:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://diatom.cc/sketchchair">Diatom</a> is a design studio that is exploring the possibilities of interaction, digital fabrication and computational design. We both graduated from the industrial design program at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.</p>

<p>Greg Saul is a designer, programmer and maker who wants to challenge the roles of the consumer and designer through his work, and was a visiting researcher at the JST ERATO Design UI Project in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Tiago Rorke has spent time teaching and researching all things digital fabrication as a teaching fellow at Victoria University, and much of his work explores the boundaries between the art and design worlds.

<p>But I&#39;m sure you are here for some pictures. Here we go:

</div></p>

<p>I do hope the guys turn this thing into a running business: I&#39;d love to buy more models of SketchChair. Greg and Tiago did indeed an amazing job!</p>
