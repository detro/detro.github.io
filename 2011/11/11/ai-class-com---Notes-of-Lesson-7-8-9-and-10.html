<meta name="description" content="I have been very busy at home and in the weekend, so I’m a bit behind with study and sharing my notes. I just finished going through the very interesting lesson 9, and I now have to start with lesson 10. I plan to do it on Saturday: tomorrow is a special night! ;-) Instead, regarding lesson 8, I just managed to put down the list of topics discussed, but for lack of time I didn’t put anything in writing just yet. Will eventually do it (maybe). UPDATE 12 Nov 2011: I just finished putting down notes of Lesson 10. Very information dense, but I can see that Prof. Norvig went “easy” on us: Reinforcement Learning could have taken way more time. Also, those two lessons are all about this guy below: better you get down and really study MDP. This stuff will hit us back in during the exams. Guess who is this guy? Here is the links: Lesson 7 Lesson 8 (for now, topic list only) Lesson 9 Lesson 10 UPDATE 2: I’d strongly suggest you go through Mostafa Abedi’s blog. His notes and examples can really help to “iron out” doubts." />
