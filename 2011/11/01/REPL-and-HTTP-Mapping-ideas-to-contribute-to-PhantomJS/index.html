                <h2>REPL and HTTP Mapping: ideas to contribute to PhantomJS</h2>
<p class="meta">01 Nov 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Recently, I&#39;m donating my spare time to the amazing <a href="http://www.ai-class.com">Stanford Online AI Class</a>, and writing down <a href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/tag/notes">notes</a> takes time.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m still working, in the spare time of the spare time, on <a href="http://www.phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>. Yes, very slowly, but I&#39;m not stall.</p>

<p>Recently two ideas have come to mind, and it&#39;s stuff I&#39;d love to see supported by PhantomJS.</p>

<h2>REPL</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">the Wikipedia article</a>:
<blockquote>
A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also known as an interactive toplevel, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>In a REPL, the user may enter expressions, which are then evaluated, and the results displayed.
</blockquote></p>

<p>What I really like of the REPL, is the idea of launching it and start typing code into it straightaway. No files to create, save and launch. It&#39;s very good when you want to quickly toy with a concept/idea, and it&#39;s so small it doesn&#39;t really <em>deserves</em> a dedicated script file for that.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t finished it yet, but I published my current status on <a href="https://github.com/detro/phantomjs/tree/dev-repl2">this branch</a>. Check it out!</p>

<p>Also, the REPL is truly enabling an even more simple concept: controlling PhantomJS by just piping commands to it through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">STD_IN</a>. A <strong>key</strong> aspect to enable easier integration of PhantomJS in larger stacks.</p>

<p>In facts, I discovered that <a href="https://github.com/sgentle">sgentle</a> has started working on wrapping PhantomJS into a Node module, and released <a href="https://github.com/sgentle/phantomjs-node">phantomjs-node</a>. What struck me is how he had to work out a <em>communication channel</em> between <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> and the instances of PhantomJS: he opted for <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a>.</p>

<p>Socket.io is definitely a <em>smart</em> solution, but phantom is launched as a child process: there must be a better way to let Node and PhantomJS speak, instead of having to pass through the network stack. Right?</p>

<p>And that&#39;s where my work on the REPL (and in general into controlling PhantomJS via STD_IN) comes into the picture.</p>

<h2>HTTP Mapping</h2>

<p>In our effort to build proper Javascript Testing into <a href="http://beta.betfair.com">Betfair&#39;s new platform</a>, a problem arises: how do we mock <em>effectively</em> and <em>easily</em> the service data responses that our code consumes?</p>

<p>Javascript, as many of you know, is not <em>easy to test</em>: it normally requires you to run your full stack to be able to test it <em>fairly</em>. But we are not giving up, and want to find a solution to be able to test our code, without having to run an entire infrastructure of services, particularly while code is actually developed. The developer has to be able to <em>work into this loop</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>type</li>
<li>save</li>
<li>run test</li>
</ol>

<p>So, here is the idea: <em>what if we could intercept all those HTTP/XHR calls that the Javascript in the page does, and Map them to local files (or even different remotes)?</em></p>

<p>PhantomJS source code is already structured to abstract the network access of the <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qwebpage.html">WebPage</a> through a <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qnetworkaccessmanager.html">NetworkAccessManager</a>. At the moment we are using it for monitoring and sniffing.</p>

<p>I want to add a functionality to the <code>webpage</code> module so that given a file <code>httpmap.json</code> that looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="json language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">[</span>
     <span class="p">{</span>
          <span class="nt">&quot;method&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;GET&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;POST&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
          <span class="nt">&quot;source&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://*.betfair.com/bla/*/test&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
          <span class="nt">&quot;destination&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;local_file.json&quot;</span>
     <span class="p">},</span>
     <span class="p">{</span>
          <span class="nt">&quot;method&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;GET&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
          <span class="nt">&quot;source&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://*.betfair.com/bla/*/api&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
          <span class="nt">&quot;destination&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
               <span class="s2">&quot;1_local_file.json&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
               <span class="s2">&quot;2_local_file.json&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
               <span class="s2">&quot;http://testapi.example.com/bla/api/test&quot;</span>
          <span class="p">]</span>
     <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>a tester that uses phantom could do something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">fs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;fs&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="nx">page</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;webpage&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">create</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="nx">HTTP_MAP</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;httpmap.json&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nx">page</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setHttpMap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">HTTP_MAP</span><span class="p">));</span>

<span class="c1">// ... do stuff with page, while the HTTP requests are mapped</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can probably guess, the format of the map offers some extra nifty features:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>method</code> field can be single (a <code>string</code>) or multiple (an array of <code>string</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>destination</code> field can be a single url (a <code>string</code>), or multiple destinations (an array of <code>string</code>) that phantom will cycle through at every matching request</li>
<li>the <code>source</code> field accepts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regexp</a>, and I&#39;m thinking to add variables</li>
</ul>

<h2>Help</h2>

<p>This are my ideas so far. It would be of GREAT help if you, PhantomJS lover, could spend sometime to review those and suggest accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Happy Testing!</strong></p>
