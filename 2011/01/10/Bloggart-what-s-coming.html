                <p>Dear Bloggart belovers (like there were any out there…), this is a quick update on what’s happening with <a href="https://github.com/detro/bloggart">my Bloggart fork</a>. Yes, <strong>fork</strong> - this is now the correct way to calling it.</p>

<p>Initially I was just touching and modelling the software to my personal needs. Now I’m really going in my own direction.</p>

<p>Anyway, let’s stay focused. I was here to tell you about a couple of new things that are coming to Bloggart.</p>

<h1 id="pages">Pages</h1>
<p>If there is one thing that I really don’t like of Bloggart, is the total absence of <strong>pages</strong> as a type of content. Pages that can be used to serve content like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a description of yourself</li>
  <li>a “homepage” for a project</li>
  <li>an “about me” page</li>
  <li>a “curriculum vitae” or “resume” page</li>
  <li>even a hierarchy of pages(!)</li>
</ul>

<p>and alike.</p>

<p>Yes, structurally we are talking of something <strong>very similar</strong> to a post - but a post has things like “comments”, “tags”, “links to previous/next” posts and so forth. Maybe I’m too picky (or too old school) (or too <em>wordpressy</em>). But that’s what I like.</p>

<p>So, I’m adding support for Page content. It’s a bit tricky, because Bloggart was designed with Posts in mind, but it’s happening.</p>

<h1 id="a-better-sitemapxml">A better <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sitemap.xml</code></h1>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps">Sitemaps</a> are currently the best way of making your website easy to crawl for search engine, ensuring always a good positioning in search result (given that your content is relevant ;-) ).</p>

<p>The current version of Bloggart generates <strong>a very basic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sitemap.xml</code></strong> (you can see mine <a href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/sitemap.xml">here</a>). Just the links without any other metadata:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span> 
<span class="nt">&lt;urlset</span> <span class="na">xmlns=</span><span class="s">"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span> 
  
    <span class="nt">&lt;url&gt;</span> 
      <span class="nt">&lt;loc&gt;</span>http://blog.ivandemarino.me/<span class="nt">&lt;/loc&gt;</span> 
    <span class="nt">&lt;/url&gt;</span> 
  
    <span class="nt">&lt;url&gt;</span> 
      <span class="nt">&lt;loc&gt;</span>http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2004/11/15/il-mio-nuovo-blogger-my-new-blogger/<span class="nt">&lt;/loc&gt;</span> 
    <span class="nt">&lt;/url&gt;</span> 
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/urlset&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bit too simple if you ask me. There are other informations that should be there, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;lastmod&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;priority&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>As you know (you do? of course you do! you <em>love</em> Bloggart, otherwise you’d not be reading this :-P), Bloggart serves static content, that has been previously generated and stored in the App Engine Datastore (and Memcache).</p>

<p>Problem is, currently the content gets <em>“statically stored”</em> without any <strong>type</strong> information. And I need that type (in addition to other metadata) to generate a better sitemap.</p>

<p>So, that’s what I’m adding.</p>
