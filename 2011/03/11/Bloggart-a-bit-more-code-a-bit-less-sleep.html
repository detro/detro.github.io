Effects of sleep deprivation (no, I'm not THAT tired)

<p>If you are one of the few a followers of <a href="https://github.com/detro/bloggart">my Bloggart fork</a>, you know what’s going on: Page support, changes to the <strong>“Squared”</strong> theme and more.</p>

<p>I’m not yet where I want to be, but it’s getting closer. While I add small features to Bloggart, I learn its intricacies, and discover some small/medium latent bugs. Stuff that <em>“didn’t happen because scenario x was never considered”</em>: this is giving me some possibilities to fix and improve.</p>

<p>I believe now Bloggart does a slightly better job using the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/deferred.html">App Engine Deferred API</a>. It’s not much, but makes you feel like you are making some use of the Google-Cloud Power. Nice to have.</p>

<p>My theme, <strong>“Squared”</strong>, is getting better, thanks mainly to the advices of the CSS-Master <a href="http://blog.ekynoxe.com/">ekynoxe</a>. His advices are very helpful and illuminating: I know very few developers that have such a great talent for design and “ability to explain themselves”. <strong>Thanks mate!</strong></p>

<p>Stay tuned: more is coming.
