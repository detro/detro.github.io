        <p>This video is great! Yes, quality wise is quite poor, it looks like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar#Early_history">first movies from Pixar</a>. But it&#39;s quite amusing and &quot;teasing&quot;. Take a second to watch it:</p>

<div class="img">

<p>Definitely, Motorola is looking better and better at every new product (<a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/05/17/droid-does-not-help-motorola-offset-market-share-loss/">even though their market share is still ridiculously small</a>). This video, with the whole set of products presented at <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=ces+2011+motorola">CES 2011</a>, like <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-ATRIX-US-EN">Atrix 4G</a> and <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Tablets/ci.MOTOROLA-XOOM-US-EN.overview">Xoom</a>, is sign that they are ready to fight and fight hard.</p>

<p>Good for you Moto!</p>

<p>But, what I&#39;m wondering about is the role of <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">Google&#39;s Android</a> in all this.</p>

<p>Google is happily supporting multiple hardware manufacturers, giving them a very good, solid, reliable, flexible and customizable OS. It&#39;s a BIG DEAL. And it&#39;s looking like a convergence is happening there. Different brands are all going for the green robot: now and fast. From my point of view, it&#39;s great and expected: there was huge need for a modern (really modern! - yes, I&#39;m looking at you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian">Symbian</a>) OS, that companies could take and make a phone out of it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s concerning is the Google&#39;s move between <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.2-highlights.html">2.2 &quot;Froyo&quot;</a> &amp; <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.3-highlights.html">2.3 &quot;Gingerbread&quot;</a>, and <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html">Android v3.0 &quot;Honeycomb&quot;</a>. Why? Because it&#39;s destabilising. In a good and, for manufacturers, in a bad way.</p>

<p>Take Samsung: <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/01/31/just-kidding-samsung-galaxy-tab-sales-are-quite-small/">Galaxy Tab</a> sales have been &quot;small&quot; and &quot;uninteresting&quot;, market wise. But THAT product is actually the first Android Tablet. Why did it fail? Because it was <em>Android-made-for-smartphones</em>. Very true and... very sad for who actually spent the money.</p>

<p>But now &quot;Honeycomb&quot; is coming. It&#39;s great, it&#39;s for tablet and all that. Super-duper for gadgets-addict, but what about Samsung, that built a product doomed to failure?</p>

<p>Most probably, it has been a &quot;Samsung choice&quot; to take what was &quot;available&quot; from Google and make a Tablet out of it. I&#39;m pretty sure Google mentioned them that <em>&quot;they were working on a specific version for tablets&quot;</em>. But Samsung made the mistake of building it anyway.</p>

<p>The question is: now, how can Samsung (and other manufacturers) feel confident with Android? How are they going to decide which version to pick? And when? Should they all depend on Google&#39;s word/work, and build their products only when Google says it&#39;s ready? Maybe yes, but are they happy to do so? Isn&#39;t this too much of a cross-company business dependency? That sounds bad to me...</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure working for Google MUST BE GREAT, but trying to imagine the pressure coming from phone manufacturers, it must be a great deal of pain.</p>

<p><strong>PS Samsung Galaxy should be updated to Honeycomb!</strong></p>
