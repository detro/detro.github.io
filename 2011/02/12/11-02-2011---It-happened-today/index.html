                <p>I&#39;m impressed. Today a lot of important things just happened, and I think it&#39;s work putting them down.</p>

<h1>Tahrir Square pushes Hosni Mubarak down</h1>

<p>After what he said yesterday night, I was not expecting this to happen so soon. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12433045">Mubarak stepped down</a>! In addition of being a great news for all my friends that are directly or indirectly related to Egypt, this is an <strong>INCREDIBLE</strong> news for something I tagged as <em>&quot;lost&quot;</em>: <strong>hope</strong>.</p>

<div class="img">

[Tahrir Square - The city in the City](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12412116)
</div>

<p>If the people of Egypt, united and determined, managed to overthrown Mubarak&#39;s regime in the name of Freedom, Fairness and Democracy. This means that on planet heart <em>hope has still a place</em>. Well done my friends: I&#39;m so happy for all of you!</p>

<h1>My 100th day at Betfair</h1>

<p>As some of you might already know, I&#39;m used to track my working days, with a physical log that comes with me in meetings and it&#39;s always next to me during the working hours.</p>

<p>Today, as I started nothing down the <em>todo</em> and <em>done</em>, I started the usual header with:
<blockquote>
Day 100 11/02/2011
...
</blockquote>
Surprise! <strong>With today is exactly 100 days I have been working for <a href="http://www.betfair.com">Betfair</a></strong>. And, in addition to that, the date, <strong>11/02/2011</strong> is a <strong>Mirror Number</strong> (&quot;1102-2011&quot;). How cool is that?!?! :)</p>

<div class="img">

</div>

<p>Also, a number of things is happening in my team: we are finalising the release of a lot of new pages on the Betfair website, that will go live soon. I don&#39;t know if I should say WHAT we are going to release, but I worked on a couple of those, on a pretty tight and  schedule, and so it&#39;s great to finally see this stuff released. That&#39;s the kind of &quot;satisfaction&quot; I was looking for, and that in Betfair I&#39;m definitely getting. <strong>Finally!</strong></p>

<h1>Microsoft finalizes their plan: acquiring Nokia</h1>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s what I believe. What just happened is that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Micro$oft</a> made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Elop">Stephen Elop</a> being hired by <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> with a plan. Make him their <em>&quot;Trojan Horse&quot;</em>: go in, fire key people that would get in the way, and make Nokia a <em>dependant</em>, an <em>asset</em> for Microsoft.</p>

<div class="img">

Elop was a Trojan Horse ([source](http://mynokiablog.com/2011/02/11/poll-on-a-scale-of-1-to-10-how-pssed-off-are-you-with-todays-nokia-news/))
</div>

<p>I&#39;m really sad about <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a>: <a href="http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2011/02/11/nokia-windows-phone-will-not-support-qt-symbian-developers-left/">WinMob phones will not support it</a>!!! This is so retarded, that proves my theory. All the <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/trolltech.html">ex-Trolltech</a> fella, as well as all the Open Source community around <a href="http://maemo.org/">Maemo</a>/<a href="http://meego.com/">MeeGo</a>, they were all let down by this deal.</p>

<p>1 year ago <em>circa</em>, when Nokia was pushing Maemo first, and MeeGo second, I was saying few things:
<blockquote>
Nokia doesn&#39;t know how to be Open Source!</p>

<p>They still need to prove that they can do it!</p>

<p>The Open Source nature of Maemo, and MeeGo, are being used to steer really <em>committed open source advocates</em> into a main Company-Driven, Far-From-Open-Source interest!</p>

<p>Be aware that this can all fall apart soon!
</blockquote></p>

<p>But, again, people don&#39;t like to listen. It&#39;s easy to jump in and associate yourself with the <em>&quot;underdog brand&quot;</em> (yes, Nokia was (and is) an underdog compared to Apple, and now it&#39;s even more).</p>

<p>What are developers going to do? Are the developers going to jump on yet another, different Nokia wagon? This will make Apple (and Google) look even more attractive: yes, of course, they are respectively a close and a semi-close environment... but they are reliable in terms of small and large business. They laid out a strategy and a target, and in the last 2/3 years they sticked with it! Quite important if you want to make a living out of Mobile Development.</p>

<p>And, again, Qt... that beautiful, brilliant, smart, well designed, well documented, evolving framework. What is Nokia going to do with that? I hope someone finds a way to recreate Trolltech and go back to what they were doing before the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/01/28/nokia-acquires-trolltech-for-153-million/">Nokia-Shit-Storm</a> started.</p>

No body knows viruses like Microsoft
</div>

<p>Elop and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a> said:
<blockquote>
Our (Nokia) Hardware, Their (Microsoft) Software.
</blockquote>
They are going to take Nokia, dismember it, toss all the work done by committed and skilled engineers in the toilet, and impose the Micro$oft crap.</p>

<p>But if you think I&#39;m too <em>&quot;extreme&quot;</em> in my judgement, read <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12427680">this mild article from BBC News</a>.</p>

<h1>&quot;Creepy&quot; Mortgage Application</h1>

<div class="img">
<img src="http://www.latinobusinessreview.com/sites/default/files/NEWS-HSBC%20Mexico.jpg" alt="HSBC" width="500" />
</div>

<p>Today I started my application for an HSBC 90% LTV Mortgage. So I went to the branch for my booked appointment, started the interview, and all was going great.</p>

<p>At certain point though, we hit a &quot;creepy&quot; moment:
<blockquote>
Do you have any plan in place to pay your mortgage if you die?</p>

<p>Who is going to repay the mortgage if you get suddenly ill and decease?</p>

<p>And what happens if you loose your Job?
</blockquote>
I&#39;m sure my face turned red and weird. Too creepy to think about this in the very moment in which all my extra-work activity is focused on <em>laying down the fundaments</em> for a house and a family.</p>

<p>Yes, I know, I need to think of all the eventuality, but... I was not ready to answer that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m going to sign for an Insurance Policy to pay off the Mortgage in case I die. Just in case, you know...</p>

<p><strong>What a day!</strong></p>
