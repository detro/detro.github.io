<p><img src="http://www.symbian.com/images/logos/symbian.png" alt="Symbian Software Ltd. logo" align="right" /> After a year and a couple of months I&#39;m going to leave <a href="http://www.symbian.com/about/contact/london/london.html">Symbian Software Ltd. (London)</a>. It has been a very good experience as my first job in [en:UK]: a way to grow mainly, first as a [en:Man], then as a [en:Software Engineer]... and then professionally in general.</p>

<p>A lot of interesting, inspiring, intelligent people (and a lot of NOT), that showed me &quot;their way&quot;: I took where it was worth it, not where it wasn&#39;t... and left where I was able to.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><img src="http://www.crossinnov.com/fr/Portals/4/image/logo_orange.gif" alt="Orange logo" align="left" /> I&#39;m joining <a href="http://www.francetelecom.com/en_EN/group/global_footprint/countries/uk/uk-lab.html">Orange Labs R&amp;D</a>, the [en:R&amp;D] division for the Mobile sector of <a href="http://www.francetelecom.com/en_EN/">France Telecom</a> in [en:UK].</p>

<p>A lot of new things are going to happen to me: new colleagues, new tasks, new technologies, new projects, ... new stuff to learn, to understand, to share, to take, to give, to enjoy, to swear at ;-) . That&#39;s Business (I suppose).</p>

<p>My official role will be &quot;<em><a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a> [en:Software Engineer]</em>&quot;, but they showed since the Interview a very big interest for my &quot;Web expertice&quot;: I practically spoke for 2 hours mainly about what I did in the past on the Web. From [en:Web Development], to [en:Ajax], to [en:Web Services], to [en:SysAdmin], to [en:DBA].
That was great: I was very stimulated from the possibility to mix what I do now, with what I did in the past.</p>

<p>My vision is this: <em>Informations must be connected and available everywhere: Web and Mobile Applications are going to be one. Mobile Applications will query the Web to bring to the Users an rich and up to date “experience”</em>. The world is going to be every day more Mobile and more Web Oriented, till we reach the point that the concept of phone as we know will simply disappear.</p>

<p>And my beloved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iPhone">iPhone</a> is the perfect example. ;)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave Symbian on the <strong>30th of June</strong>, and start in Orange on the <strong>1st of July</strong>: it&#39;s going to be painful to have to wake up so early... so suddenly; that&#39;s because the office of Orange, even if it&#39;s in a beautiful place, is <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=se1+8lx&daddr=w4+5ya&sll=51.496727,-0.273867&sspn=0.007681,0.021608&ie=UTF8&ll=51.499126,-0.191917&spn=0.061447,0.172863&z=13">here</a>. In <a href="http://www.enjoy-work.com/html/theidea.html">Chiswick Business Park</a> (yes, a business park with a dedicated Web Site!).

Impressive, isn&#39;t it! ;-) </div></p>

<p>How can I end this Post?
Mmm, nothing. Just wish me <em>Good Luck</em>!</p>
