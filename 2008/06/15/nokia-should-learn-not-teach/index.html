<p>From <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/06/13/123206">Slashdot</a>:

<strong>Nokia Urges Linux Developers To Be Cool With DRM</strong>
<hr />
<a href="mailto:superglaze@hotmail.com">superglaze</a> writes in to note that according to Nokia&#39;s software chief, its plans for open source include getting developers to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jun2008/gb20080612_288518.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business">accept things like DRM, commercial IP rights, and SIM locks</a>.</p>

<p>«<a href="http://jaaksi.blogspot.com/">[Ari] Jaaksi</a> admitted that concepts like these &quot;go against the open-source philosophy,&quot; but said they were necessary components of the current mobile industry.
&quot;Why do we need closed vehicles? We do,&quot; he said.
&quot;Some of these things harm the industry but they&#39;re here [as things stand]. These are touchy, emotional issues, but this dialogue is very much needed. As an industry, we plan to use open-source technologies, but we are not yet ready to play by the rules; but this needs to work the other way round too.&quot;»
</blockquote></p>

<p>So, <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> wants to EAT using the knowledge and the software that the Open Source Community created... and, at the same time, change it&#39;s culture and impose concepts that are COMPLETELY against the Open Source &quot;philosophy&quot; itself. Interesting...
Instead of learning of the quality of what the Open Source community is capable of doing using a development model built around <strong>&quot;equality and quality&quot;</strong>, they want to teach/impose? And to who? To the <a href="http://trolltech.com/">Trolltech</a> employee? They are free to do so... but this does not mean that the rest of the Community will change its mind.
<a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">QT</a>? There is <a href="http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php">KDE that has a foundation to protect it</a> PLUS there is always <strong>the Fork option</strong> ;-) .
Think about <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> and <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/">X.org</a>: nowdays they lost all the users... because of the stupid decision of changing the license.</p>

<p>Sorry mates, this is not the right way. And now you are not the only player any more: still the biggest... but this is changing, and the Q4-2007 + Q1-2008 says that more than anything else.</p>
