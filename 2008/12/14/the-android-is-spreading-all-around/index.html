<p>It started when just the first versions of the <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/und/android/download_list.html">SDK</a> were out in the wild: people were &quot;just&quot; recompiling the kernel, and boom! The magic was happening. That was a demonstration of really good and effective layering: just adapting the kernel to the hosting hardware was making it <em>up and running</em>.</p>

<p>Now, with <a href="http://source.android.com/">the source code available to everyone</a>, the porting festival is becoming even larger, with small-medium company, as well as university guys, porting Android everywhere.</p>

<p>A couple of very interesting example are the <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3641439368.html">Porting on Nokia 810</a> (<a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/">LinuxDevices.com</a>) made by <a href="http://www.nthcode.com/pubs/porting-android-to-a-new-device.html">NthCode</a> and the <a href="http://androidguys.com/?p=3070">Porting on HTC Touch</a> from <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=382265">Martin Johnson</a> (<a href="http://it029000.massey.ac.nz/vogue/">Massey University&#39;s student</a>).</p>

<p>The first article is interesting because it discusses the changes made by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> to the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">vanilla Linux Kernel</a>: it shows how deep into the Linux they went to make it good for Mobile Devices... and how much <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> didn&#39;t for the [en:N810].</p>

<p>The second one, instead, shows how simple is, even for a device that is on the market and that runs a completely different <a href="%5Ben:Windows%20Mobile%5D">en:Operating System</a>: this means total absence of any toolchain or Linux driver, neither binary nor open source.</p>
