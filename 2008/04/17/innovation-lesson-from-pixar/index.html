Innovation is one of the major topics that all the Big companies speaks all the time about: how, what, when... Innovation?</p>

<p>When the reality is of a little/medium size company, Innovation is easy: you don&#39;t need to convince, motivate, move people. Teams with &quot;Innovation in mind&quot; just pop out from the ground... and a good manager just need to feed and support them.

Bird joined Pixar in 2000, when the company was riding high following its release of the world’s first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story, and the subsequent hits A Bug’s Life and Toy Story 2. Concerned about complacency, senior executives Steve Jobs, Ed Catmull, and John Lasseter asked Bird, whose body of work included The Iron Giant and The Simpsons, to join the company and shake things up. The veteran of Walt Disney, Warner Brothers, and FOX delivered—winning Academy Awards (best animated feature) for two groundbreaking movies, The Incredibles and Ratatouille.
