<p>It&#39;s incredible.
She was here around with us, working with us. Managing the career of people. Of Software Engineer like me.
English: controlled, polite but sociable and engaged and enthusiast in her job.</p>

<p>Vomiting. Strong Vomiting.
Anyone assumed was just a Virus of the Flue a little bit stronger than usual.</p>

<p>My Engineering Manager&#39;s email of yesterday:
<blockquote>
What Suzanne thought was the sickness and vomiting bug actually turned out
to be a small brain haemorrhage when she went to A&amp;E last Wednesday night.
Martin, Suzanne&#39;s husband, called on Thursday to let me know what was
happening and indicated at that time that Suzanne would require an
operation.</p>

<p>On talking to him yesterday it transpired that Suzanne has had a subsequent
haemorrhage on Sunday night....
</blockquote></p>

<p>Today she passed.
<strong>This is just crazy.</strong></p>
