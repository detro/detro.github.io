Mac Rumors <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2006/02/20060202070007.shtml">talks about Apple Tablet Patents</a>:
<blockquote>A search at the US Patent and Trademark Office reveals a number of new Apple patent applications that relate to the long-rumored Apple Tablet based computer.</blockquote>

One of the most relevant:

<blockquote><strong>Gestures for touch sensitive input devices</strong> - Methods and systems for processing touch inputs are disclosed. The invention in one respect includes reading data from a multipoint sensing device such as a multipoint touch screen where the data pertains to touch input with respect to the multipoint sensing device, and identifying at least one multipoint gesture based on the data from the multipoint sensing device.</blockquote>

There are various patents here but, the most important idea of <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2006/01/01/ive-has-become-cbe/">Ive</a> (J. Ive rulez! ;) ), for me, is this <strong>finger-zoom system</strong> (look at the picture): increasing the distance between 2 finger on the monitor, increase the zoom-level in our application.
An amazing-power-usefull concept: it seems to be like that movie... mmm... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_%28film%29">Minority Report</a>, where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise">T. Cruise</a> use only his hands to move and manage a big amount of data, zooming and rotating it easly.
