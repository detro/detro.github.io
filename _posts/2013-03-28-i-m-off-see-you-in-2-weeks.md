This message is for the few souls that care. This is for the few people that maybe are waiting for me to fix/implement stuff on [GhostDriver](https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver) or [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs) (for the latter you have coverage, as the team on that is rich of geniuses - so you won't miss my average-hood).

I'm **getting married** (crazy, right?) and will be mostly off-line. I should be back from the second week of April.

Surely there will be the usual _casual-tweet_ but nothing major.

See ya!
