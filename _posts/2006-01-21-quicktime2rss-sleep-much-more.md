<blockquote><em><strong>Apple to offer speedy lecture podcasts</strong></em>

The forthcoming QuickTime 2 Really Simple Syndication (RSS) technology, a development program to be launched in Europe in the spring, will allow the lecturer to record their own "performance" - their slides, notes and details of student assignments as they deliver them live to the students in the lecture hall.

Once the lecture is over, the technology behind the system can turn the content into suitable files and automatically upload them to Apple's iTunes network or connect it to RSS feeds that students, and others, can subscribe to.
