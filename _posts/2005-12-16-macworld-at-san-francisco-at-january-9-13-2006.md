I'm sure: all mac users already know what the next <strong>MacWorld</strong> promise to deliver us.
I wants only to "<em>highlight</em>" you the sure date and the official link: <a href="http://www.macworldexpo.com/live/20/">http://www.macworldexpo.com/live/20/</a>.

Jobs, of course, present the event the January 9. Any idea about that? :D :D :D
