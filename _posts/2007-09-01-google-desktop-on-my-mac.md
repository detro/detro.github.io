I tried it from the first release, but I was disappointed because of the "heavyness" of the indexing process: all my apps seems to be like "yawning" at every interaction I did.

But because I like <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> (<strong>yes, I said! I like it!</strong>) I thought "why don't give to it another chance?".

I read a post on the <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-desktop-for-mac-in-9-more.html">Official Google Mac Blog</a> about the latest release (1.1.0.520 (8/31/2007)) and I simply installed it (not a classical <a href="http://s.sudre.free.fr/Stuff/PackageMaker_Howto.html">Mac OS X installer</a>, but we can forgive this...).

I'll let you know if all the improvement are enough to "avoid to kill the performance of my pretty honey [en:iBook|IceBook]".
