Yesterday, waiting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_%28mythology%29">Morfeus</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_%28mythology%29">the God</a>, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_%28The_Matrix%29">the Blue-Pill-Red-Pill Freak</a>) to catch me and bring me to sleep. I had this movie in my beloved <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/tag/iphone/">iPhone</a>, "<a href="http://www.larsandtherealgirl-themovie.com/">Lars and the Real Girl</a>".

It's pure gold. A movie about a guy, Lars (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331516/">Ryan Gosling</a>), who has a very strange mental disease, that needs a Girlfriend but is unable to catch-and-kiss the classical Next-Door-Girl (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0307726/">Kelli Garner</a>) that loves him... also if she is aware of his sickness.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_and_the_Real_Girl">More info and the full plot is on Wikipedia</a> (for whom likes spoilering ;) ).

What I strongly suggest to follow is the recitation of what is not said: eyes, movements, expressions, breaths too. Everything is done in a perfect harmony. The perception is of a classical American town that is completely disconnected from the outside world, and mainly because of this is able to "help" Lars.

Best character? Dr. Dagmar (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0165101/">Patricia Clarkson</a>). Her recitation is pure gold, a perfect not-yet-so-old woman who lost her husband and... now is just... lonely.
During an "interview" with Lars she speaks about her self:
<blockquote>
[...]
Sometimes I get so lonely I forget what day it is, and how to spell my name.
[...]
</blockquote>

I strongly suggest to give a try to this movie. It's slow and "delicate": give it the time to catch your interest, and pay attention to every whispering (in there is the pure gold of this movie).
