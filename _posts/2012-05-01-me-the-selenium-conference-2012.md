It's widely spread opinion that at some point of our career we, software people, should start giving speeches and talks. I'm firmly convinced that THAT is not for me, and I want to carve my ears out of my head every time I hear my _heavily-accented-english_, mixed with my ability to cut words and make the message come across barely understandable.

But, this presentation was really important to me: I presented my-work-so-far on building a [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) WebDriver. I call it [GhostDriver](http://detro.github.com/ghostdriver/) (provisional name).

Well, my terrible English aside, GhostDriver is underway. And once is done, [it's stable releases will be part of PhantomJS](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/phantomjs/cUZPBTz7Fkw/discussion).

What I need now is a real hand from people that know how WebDriver internally works: so far the **`#selenium` channel on `irc.freenode.net`** (and the great people on it) has been an invaluable resource for me.

_Wishing me good luck is a welcome gesture. But more welcome will be your Pull Requests! ;-)_

## Hey, you selfish, what about the conference?

Oh yes, I almost forgot! [Selenium Conference 2012](http://www.seleniumconf.org/) was **Really Good!!!**

Organizers, speakers, venue: all great. Every topic was source of inspiration, both for your daily work, or for your career in general. But my favourite was the [talk about MDD by Matt Wynne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQUCxR3dhcQ). Watch it and laugh! :)

Video of [ALL the talks are on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/seleniumconf). _Enjoy!_
