Saw 4 is on is way. And who LOVE this series knows that will be very very... very difficult to make something better than the previous movies. But this clip, with the autopsy of JigSaw, is just PERFECT!!!
Everything as usual: <strong>unexpected and bleeding</strong>.

Probably... a little bit of spoilering... or not? I think not! Take a look and let me know.

By the way, I putted it after "continue..." because the images very horrifying (I'd say "amazing", but someone will think I'm a Serial Killer ;-) ).
