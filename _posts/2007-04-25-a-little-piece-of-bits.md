I don't know HOW but... I'm online. Someone, for my luckyness, doesn't know the meaning of the words like "Security", "Privacy", "Protection", "Encryption", "Authorization", "Identification"...

It's not a post, it's only to say that "I'm not dead": I have only little problems.
<ol>
<li>I'm now a London Citizen (I live at the 253 of Horn Lane, near North Acton Tube Station)</li>
<li>I'm a Graduate of the <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a> BootCamp codename "Donatello"</li>
<li>I don't have a Broadband yet (but the Landlord says it will be there on Friday of this week)</li>
</ol>

See you soon.
