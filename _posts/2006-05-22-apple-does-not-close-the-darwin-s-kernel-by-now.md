In the last week, some <a href="http://www.ossblog.it/post/945/apple-chiude-il-codice-di-darwin/">blogs</a> and <a href="http://os.newsforge.com/os/06/05/17/1957258.shtml?tid=6&tid=150">online-tech</a><a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=14663&Page=1&pagePos=8">nical-newspaper</a> speaks about the Apple's intention to close the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/opensource/index.html">Darwin's Kernel Source Code</a> for Intel.

Last Friday, Ernest Prabhakar, Product Manager and Open Source & Open Standards Mac OS X Product Marketing at Apple Computer, <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/Fed-talk/2006/May/msg00105.html">says</a>:
<blockquote>Hi all,
Just to be clear, Tom Yager was *speculating* about why we have -- so far -- not released the source code of the kernel for Intel-based Macintoshes.  We continue to release *all* the Darwin sources for our PowerPC systems, and so far has released all the non-kernel Darwin sources for Intel.

Nothing has been announced, so he (and everyone else) certainly has the right to speculate.  But please don't confuse "speculation" with "fact."

Thanks,
-- Ernie P.

What's the Fact?
Apple did not release the Source of Darwin-Intel Kernel by now.
But I think we can expect for an incoming release very soon (can Apple renounces to the Open Souce Community around Darwin? We (and Apple also) MUST consider the big work done by the comunity of <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org/">www.opendarwin.org</a>).
