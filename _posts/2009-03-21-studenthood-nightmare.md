This is <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2009/02/15/it-happens-to-me-all-the-time/">another thing it happens to me as well</a>!
I don't really know what does it says: probably that some of the studenthood "duty" left a deep mark on our subconscious, making us imagine realities in which we "didn't do our job"... and now we pay the consequences.

<strong>Or, simply, that some teachers at school should be reported for "mental raping"! :-D</strong>
