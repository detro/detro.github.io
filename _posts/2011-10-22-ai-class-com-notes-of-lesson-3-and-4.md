This week the [ai-class](https://www.ai-class.com/) was about [Probability](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability), [Bayes Networks](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) and [Inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference).

For people like me, that have to find _patches of free time_ to study this course, there is a good news: you can do **Homeworks 2** just by studying the first of the 2 lessons. This can help to prioritise your schedule, and study the second lesson (that focuses on the "computation" over Bayes Networks) with a little bit more peace of mind.

This guy was great at inference ;-)

Of course, I'm assuming you are doing the Advanced Track, where there are deadlines.

I have here my notes of the 2 classes:

* [3. Probability in AI](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/3f520502-9119-460a-bac6-1760fb0f0a72/4913d7d005608b878aed8fe1c8f20a3b)
* [4. Probabilistic Inference](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/cda9eda7-b825-44ff-91b4-48626891cd3e/933cf74b53520f73adf4c68113d59931)

<del>The second notes about "Inference" are still a **work in progress**, as I completed only half of the videos so far. Will try to finish it before Monday.</del>

Now it's time for some [mussles](http://www.brouge.co.uk/Rich_Map_Page.html).

**UPDATE 1**: I have been asked for the notes of my Homework 1. [Here you go](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/d0ca9568-799d-4efe-82a1-817882ff4581/2964f322bc4072aad30b35ca3d9e3b6b). But bear in mind: given those are homework, I didn't put in them proper explanation. I suggest you watch the videos for that. ;-)

**UPDATE 2**: I'm done with notes of Lesson 4, "Probabilistic Inference". Prof. Norvig concludes the lesson presenting the [Monty Hall Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem): a very interesting one! If you want my explanation of the Monty Hall problem, check out [my notes](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/cda9eda7-b825-44ff-91b4-48626891cd3e/933cf74b53520f73adf4c68113d59931). I think I did a _decent_ job at explaining it.
