The piano is a "frightening" instrument for me. I have a lot of walls. I have thousands of bricks making these walls. I have my castle that helps me to fight against all the bad things. But the piano is like an earthquake that destroy everything around. And it leaves me alone with my self.
A terrible comparison between the exterior me and the interior me.
Two sides of the same person, that can't live together in the same place: at least one must die. Or disappear.

I hate the piano. The piano is a "frightening" instrument.
