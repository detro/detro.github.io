In the last period I'm spending some time working with <a href="http://appengine.google.com">Google AppEngine</a>: if you don't know what is it, be ashamed! :P

I would like to highlight a couple of interesting resources that can make the life of who works with this <strong>framework</strong>/<strong>hosting platform</strong>/<strong>cloud computing system</strong> easier:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/">Google AppEngine Cookbook</a> with a lot of good recipe (there are few now, written by the Googlers, but I'm sure it's gona blow up soon)</li>

<li><a href="http://appgallery.appspot.com/">The App Gallery</a>, with a lot of interesting applications already in production phase</li>
<li>A set of <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/">Articles</a> on "how to do this and that" (sort of little CookBook)</li>

	<li>The <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/0.96/templates/">Django Documentation about Templates (v0.96)</a>: the Template engine used in AppEngine (a superb one, I must say)</li>
<li><a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/">The official Project Blog</a>, with news, tips, tricks and other stuff</li>
</ul>

It was long time I was planning to learn <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>: AppEngine looked like the right way to do so and jump on the <a href="http://www.python.org/~guido/">Guido</a>'s carriage.

What I'm working on? Nothing special, nothing comples, nothing huge. This time, <strong>Simplicity</strong> is the keyword. ;-)
