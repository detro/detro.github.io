First release, first problem.

After a lot of research about the standard [en:ISO 4217] (the one that define the “3 letter name” for every currency in the world) and all the symbols of European currencies, I miss one: the [en:Slovenian Tolar].

If someone is able to find it out and, ideally, to give me the relative [en:Unicode_Symbols|Unicode] it will be very appreciated.

<strong>Also</strong>, I'm looking for someone able to translate the name of the different currencies (13) in, at least, French, German and Spanish. Other languages are welcome too. <a href="http://secretum.neminis.org">Manu</a>, this call is to you ;) .
