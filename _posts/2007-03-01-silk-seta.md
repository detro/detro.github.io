"Wandering" on <a href="http://www.cineblog.it/post/4435/il-trailer-di-silk-seta-di-baricco">Cine|blog</a> I have found something special and unexpecteed: [en:Silk_(film)|the cinematographic transposition] <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494834/">of Silk</a>.

Silk is a novel by Italian writer [en:Alessandro Baricco]. It was translated into English in 1997 by Guido Waldman. A new English translation by Ann Goldstein was published in 2006.

Lelly has lent it to me two months ago: I have read it in few ours!!! A beautiful history of love and passion, <em>written without written words</em>: everything is a gesture, an intuition, a reference to something <em>thinkable but not expressible</em>.

From Wikipedia:
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Silk</b></i> is the film adaptation of Italian author [en:Alessandro Baricco]'s novel of the same name. It will be released in [en:2007] through New Line Cinema, directed by the <i>[en:Red Violin]</i> director, [en:Francois Girard].</p>
<p>The [en:United States|American] actor [en:Michael Pitt] will star in the lead role of the French silkworm smuggler Hervé Joncour and the British actress [en:Keira Knightley] will appear as the Hélène, wife of Hervé. Japanese actors [en:Miki Nakatani] and [en:Koji Yakusho] have also been cast. Exterior Japanese scenes will be filmed in the city of [en:Sakata%2C_Yamagata|Sakata] from the end of March. Keira's scenes will be filmed in Italy in April, exactly in [en:Sermoneta], a small medieval village near [en:Latina%2C_Italy|Latina].</p>
<p>The film will be screened at the [en:Cannes Film Festival] in 2007.</p>
