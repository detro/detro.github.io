<img src="http://s.wordpress.org/about/images/logos/wplogo-hoz-rgb.png" alt="WordPress Official logo" width="200" align="right" />Yes, I did it. Finally.
It was on my todo-list since last year and I decided, in this moment of confusion and 100 things to do, to update.

Why? Because <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/12/coltrane/">Wordpress 2.7</a> was released recently, and I decided that I was "late enough".

Codename of this release? "Coltrane"! Yes, like [en:John Coltrane] ;-) .

<strong>Update:</strong> And this update comes from my iPhone! I can finally use the WordPress app.
