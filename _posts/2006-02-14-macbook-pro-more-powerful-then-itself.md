Singular but nice move from Apple: every booked (and now in distribution) MacBook Pro will be delivered with a SpeedBump Gift!

Core Duo <strong>1,83GHz will be delivered with a Core Duo 2Ghz</strong>, the <strong>1,67GHz with a 1,83GHz</strong>. 

<strong>And, as it's not enough, a new Core Duo 2,16GHz is be avalaible as an order-option!!!</strong>
