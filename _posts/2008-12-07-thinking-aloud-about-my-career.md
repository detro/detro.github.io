I don't know exactly how to express what's happening to me. I mean, to be quick, I'd say that "<em>I'm doing well with my Career</em>". But that's not my point here; and I don't think you really care, do you?
Plus, it'd show how little humble I'm: not really helpful social and friend wise. ;-)

<h3>Discovering Native Skills</h3>
What I'm realizing is that what we all have "<em>Native Skills</em>". Skills that are not based on "<em>what we studied</em>", but just "<em>built-in</em>" our self. Some of us are shy, selfish, pessimist, lazy. Some are sociable, selfless, optimist, proactive. Some have strong personalities, automatically suitable to command, even in "<em>structures</em>" where they are not supposed to. Some have weak and unconfident personalities, that are controllable even when they are "<em>in charge</em>".

All this is not part of a training or a study: is just what life made us of. Events, facts, actions, problems: they "<em>shaped</em>" us in this way. And there is no course that is going to change this. Except, of course, some events...

For me, I recognize my self as a strong, dominating personality: this makes very easy for me to "<em>go in charge</em>" quite easily. Even when a particular project doesn't have me as "manager", my way of speaking, my strength on expressing what I think should be done, my flexibility about topics, and my ability of learning fast, quickly qualifies me as "<em>the one to follow</em>".
But, at the same time, I miss that "<em>Politically Correct</em>" touch. I'm not "<em>diplomatic</em>". I say what I think, even if this can be offensive for someone.
It's why I know that I can't be, at least at this stage, a Project Manager or even an higher level Manager.

<h3>Consolidating Personality</h3>
We all know what we are. At least, we keep learning about ourself all the life long. But we can all recognize a turning point, I guess. It's when we realize that "<em>we have our own personality</em>". Is when we completely drop our "<em>high school</em>" habit and start to act based on:
<ul>
<li>What we really like</li>
<li>What we really want</li>
<li>What we really feel</li>
</ul>

That's important: it becomes <strong>our brand</strong>, what people recognize as "<em>added value</em>" on what we do.

Personally, I'm "<em>consolidating</em>" it. Living on my own, for almost 2 years now, is teaching me what <strong>I'm</strong>. <strong>What I like</strong>. <strong>What I want</strong>. And... <strong>how I feel about that</strong>.

<h3>Evolving Career</h3>
I'm an analyser. I always think about "<em>why</em>" and "<em>how</em>" and "<em>what</em>" and "<em>who</em>". I always need to understand "<em>What's going on</em>". And who knows me, knows what I'm talking about.

I see the previous two points, <strong>Skills</strong> and <strong>Personality</strong>, as my driving factors now. I'm doing good, I must say. And, I think, it's mainly because of that: not my knowledge or my studies, but my Skills and my Personality.
And, for the same reasons, I'm realizing more and more what I can become... and what I can't. It's, at the same time, recognize my limits and focusing on my qualities.

What is going to happen next, I don't know. I could discover new things, both good or bad about myself. <strong>But I'll keep analysing</strong>.
