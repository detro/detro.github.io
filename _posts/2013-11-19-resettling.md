**Puff, Pant!** THAT was not easy! But finally, "normality" seems not too far
away now.

Many things have happened in the recent months: we got married; I helped my
lovely wife with the pregnancy (well, she did all the hard work); and, on the
7th of November, we have became parents of _Leonardo Antonio DE MARINO-SIMOLA_.

We now hope to slowly learn to leave our new life together: while we learn
how to be parents, Leonardo will be learning how to be a baby. What now looks
like a difficult, consuming and intense task, will at some point become
"daily routine" (though, a much sweeter one with him at the center of it all).

It is a full **RESET** to which we need to **SETTLE**. A **RESETTLE**. A new life,
with many unknows to uncover, but also the will and need to be as united and as
strong - actually even more. But love seems to be our great strength, and
Alessandra adn I seem to be quite good at _teamwork_.

## Night sleep: a memory of the past

Well, as EVERYONE warned us, sleeping with a newborn baby is like trying to play
videogames _like in the old days_: you ALWAYS want to do, and never manage to.

Leonardo is a very unstable sleeper so far, and he seems to like to be more
active during the night: maybe a good skill if he decides to join me in the
_craft of proframming_, but as for now it's just an energy drain. A drain that
transforms into a sweet smile once you see his eyes looking at you. You are
tired, you are exausted but, somehow, his puffy cheeks make everything perfect.

## Time for ourselves

This is close to `0` for now. Either as a couple, or on our own, time to do
stuff by yourself seems a very hard thing to achieve. But I'm sure it will get
better: myself I'm still a night-worker, so with his sleeping becoming more
regular, working a bit on **opensource** or playing videogames will be
eventually possible.

I have even managed to conclude the blog migration! It took a while to do
the different bits, and I still have stuff to work on, but I'm now serving this
from [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the static HTML/CSS/JS.
Much happier: I can move to any other hosting in a matter of hours. I don't
even know anymore why I was bothering to do in any other way.

If interested, the repository with all the generating source code (posts +
Jekyll plugins) can be found at my
[detro/detro.github.io "source" branch](https://github.com/detro/detro.github.io/tree/source).

## Resume blogging

Well, this is a first attempt. Not a great one, I admit -
I find quite difficult to come up with things to say, when my brain it's
working 50%. But I do have a TODO list on my whiteboard of things I want to
talk about:

1. I have bought and setup a [N54L](http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html?oid=5336624#!tab=features)
[ZFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) NAS at home: some of the decisions
I made during that are worth sharing
2. I need to write an update on the status of the
[GhostDriver](https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver) and
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) projects
3. I have a satiric bible-related story that I want to publish (very short and
quite offensive :P)
4. ... TODO ...

## Catching up with personal projects

I have been quite far from [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/),
GhostDriver and PhantomJS. Partially is my fault (I did spend some time
playing _GTA V_ before Leonardo was here), but mostly is because of all the
above.

While I don't really have a fully up-to-date picture of the PhantomJS, I know
that [Vitallium is working on the porting to Qt5](https://github.com/Vitallium/phantomjs-qt5).
That is a very exciting perspective, and the project looks like it has a
brilliant future ahead.

Also, the [Trolls are moving towards Chromium/Blink](http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2013/06/25/experimenting-with-chromium-and-qt/):
this means that PhantomJS architecture will have to change sensibly, but
also that PhantomJS might essentially become a fully scriptable, headless
Chrome. And given Chrome's market-share, that is quite a good perspective.

GhostDriver has received some love (aka _Pull Requests_). It's now my duty/desire
to:

* fully review them
* integrate them
* prepare a new release
* push for a new release of PhantomJS that would integrate that
* and, while at it, work on some new features (long overdue)

But of course doing good work requires time and concentration.

## And more...

Well, there are more things happening in the background. Who knows me
personally, knows what I'm up to, but I have been asked to hold on for a
little longer.

So, I guess, another blog-post will be mandatory ;)
