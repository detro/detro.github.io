I can't put it any simpler: buy and read those 2 books ASAP.

<div style="float: left;" align="center">

<em>Getting Real</em>

<em>Rework</em>
</div>

This is proper stuff. This is stuff that translates into words what you, <strong>THE DEVELOPER</strong>, would like to have in your daily work life.

And probably the reason for which having a pet project, something where <strong>you set the rules</strong>, helps remaining sane, and sometimes to dream that, one day, you will be on your own.
