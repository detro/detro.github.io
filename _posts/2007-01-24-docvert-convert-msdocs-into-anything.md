<img src="http://static.blogo.it/ossblog/docvert.png" alt="Docvert logo" align="right" /><blockquote> This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services">web service</a> software takes multiple word processor files (typically .doc) and converts them to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>.

Web Service receives .doc file and converts it to a Oasis OpenDocument 1.0 which can then be converted to HTML, RSS, or any XML format.

The resulting OpenDocument is then optionally converted to HTML or any XML. This is done with <a href="http://holloway.co.nz/docvert/faq.html#xml-pipelines">XML Pipelines</a>, an approach that supports XSLT, breaking up content over headings or sections, and saving those results to multiple files (e.g., chapter1.html, chapter2.htmlâ€¦).

The result is returned in a .zip file. </blockquote>

The software is a PHP Script that expose a WS and a Web Interface, that help and symplify to reach its aim.
