It's true?
An Apple technician <a target="_new" href="http://www.melablog.it/post/1291/1tb-su-mac-apple-prepara-la-nuova-piattaforma-multimediale#more">say no</a>, but some users says that <a target="_new" href="http://loop.worldofapple.com/archives/2005/12/31/mac-shifts-bandwidth-limit-to-1tb/">our accounts indicates 1 Terabyte</a>.

IMHO, Apple is preparing a service of online video-selling based on a remote disk (no video file on computer users bu only streaming): it's for security (for majors), but... <strong>Jobs knows  users know!</strong> ;)
