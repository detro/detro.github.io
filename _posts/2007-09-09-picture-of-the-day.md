<strong>Update 10th of Sep 2007:</strong> The name of the Restaurant is <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=l&hl=en&geocode=&q=grilli&near=40+goodge+street,+london&ie=UTF8&ei=oAzlRvo1h7DYAvzalaEF&cd=1&reviews=1&cid=51519572,-135477,16630107017113269457&action=open&om=1&ll=51.521635,-0.13499&spn=0.004753,0.010257&z=17">"Sig. Grilli - Ristorante Pizzeria" in 40 Goodge Street, London W1</a>. I wrote a review about it in Italian ;)
<hr />

It was parked in <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=tottenham+court+road,+london&sll=54.162434,-3.647461&sspn=12.290357,29.882813&ie=UTF8&ll=51.518651,-0.132147&spn=0.003185,0.007296&z=17&om=1">Tottenham Court Road</a>. We were just out of an Italian Restaurant (£25.00 each... for a beef steak and House's Red Wine!!!)... when I saw it:

Who the HELL they are? We really don't know! 2 Girls with other 2 darkish Guys. They asked to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lucabox/1347650209/">Luca</a>, the author of these beautiful pictures, &laquo;Why he was taking a picture of the ground!!!&raquo; O_o
I thought to ask them to take a picture with the bus just to "shut them up".

<strong>Stupidity, No Limits!</strong>
