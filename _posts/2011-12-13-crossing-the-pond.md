I borrowed the title from [a guy](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/) who kickstarted all of this. _Thanks Ariya ;)_

I'm leaving [Betfair](http://www.betfair.com). I owe a lot to this company: for a bit longer than a year I have had the pleasure to work with smart, enlightened, knowledgeable people from which I learned loads. Leaving was definitely not an easy choice.

The only thing didn't happen, is that I didn't become a proper _punter_: I just learned that even something sounding "boring" as betting on sports, can actually be a very big challenge in terms of the technologies involved. Even more, if you try to do it in the _Betfair way_: with million of customers, all constantly hammering the servers to make the most out of their money.

## Where am I going?
On January I'll be joining [Neustar](http://www.neustar.biz/), working with the [Webmetrics](http://www.webmetrics.com/) team, based in [San Diego](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego).

Google searches about San Diego return only this kind of picture ;)

Webmetrics works in the business of Monitoring and Testing websites. It's a big player in this market and I'm going to help on scaling their infrastructure to use the **light-and-awesome** [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/).

Also, I'll try to add my bit to the already [remarkable amount of work they share with the Open Source community](http://opensource.webmetrics.com/): people like [Patrick](http://blog.lightbody.net/post/11867646583/where-the-heck-has-patrick-been) [Lightbody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb0m2xxWEg8), creator of [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) RC, works there!

I'll be reporting to Simon Nicoud: folks that navigate the Web Velocity waters must remember him for his talks at [Velocity Conf](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2011/public/schedule/speaker/18382).

## I'm not _exactly_ moving to the USA
**Love is a very important thing in Life**, especially if you have found it. In the name of it, I decided to try to marry love-need with work-aspiration: I'll still be based in UK, but travel on a regular basis to USA. This will require me to become a very frequent flyer, and learn all the tricks of [jet lag management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_lag#Management).

I'm very excited about this: working in the USA, with USA folks is something I always wanted to experience. And now I finally can. Plus, I'll be working on technologies I'm really into: what better can I ask for?

Plus, San Diego seems like a REALLY nice place to be. So, I'm not going to miss the english weather. Right? ;)

_See you downtown!_
