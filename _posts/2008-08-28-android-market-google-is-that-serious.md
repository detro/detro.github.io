About the news itself, I invite you to spend 2 minutes to read directly from <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2008/08/android-market-user-driven-content.html">the words of Eric Chu</a> on the official blog.

Said that, what is not defined yet (just the screenshot you see here) is <strong>Security</strong>. Better, what exactly they have in mind? Just put on the Market <em>WHATEVER</em> the developer will come with and leave to the final user the <strong>burden</strong> of reading, understanding and accepting/rejecting the application. Based on <strong>just</strong> some words written on a little screen? Words that sounds like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-3PO">C3PO</a>?

When I first met <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rundfunk">Jason Chen</a>, a Google Android Developer Advocate who did the <a href="http://services.google.com/events/london_android_code_day">Android Code Day here in London</a>, that &laquo;this idea was not going to work!&raquo;. And all the other mobile developers agreed with me. And I still believe that sort of "<em>Test&Approve</em>" infrastructure is needed.

And one of the newest, but very <em>noisy</em>, guy out there is doing <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">a decent job</a> on that ;-) .

But I can be wrong. Or <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> showed just "half of the cake".
