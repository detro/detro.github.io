Today, after the "fast switch" to <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2005/12/29/migrated-to-wordpress2/">WP2.0</a>, I decide to change my layout: after I saw it on Firefox and IE on a CRT monitor (I work always on my lovelly IceBook) and... orrible.

At the same time, I founded the <a title="K2" target="_blank" href="http://binarybonsai.com/k2/">K2 theme engine</a> (simple and clean). And the Chameleon stylesheet on that <a title="k2 styles at Oakleys Corner" target="_blank" href="http://oakley.bioinformaticsonline.co.uk/k2-styles/">page</a> (very good base).

With a little CSS work, this is the result. Probably, in the next week I change little things, for example the logo (I love my old logo) but now... it's ok.

-EDIT-

:oops: On IE this new layout doesn't work correctly: the sidebar go to south :evil:. But... I'm not interested about this. <strong>I hate IE! :twisted:</strong>
