Less than 30 minutes ago I have received <strong>THE</strong> call from G. A. from <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian Ltd.</a> Human Resources. I was waiting this call until the last 22nd of January, the day I came back from [en:London] after the Assessment Day of Symbian.

Few details:
<ul>
	<li>Position: Software Engineer in London Office</li>
	<li>Starting date: 2nd week of April</li>
	<li>Salary: ENOUGH ( ;) ) x Year + 2 retouch during the first 2 years</li>
	<li>Type: Permanent Contract</li>
</ul>

I'll go in London for a "briefing" on [en:C++] in the second week of March: I don't need the briefing so much, I'm not so young with C++... but it's a very good chance to exercise my english. ;) 

<strong>I'm very very very very... very very very... very very HAPPY!!!</strong>

Hey guys, I'm IN! I'm finally moving to London!!! A DREAM, a so <strong>loved, waited and desired DREAM</strong> is becoming REALITY!!!
