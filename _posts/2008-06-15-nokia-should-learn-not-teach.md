From <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/06/13/123206">Slashdot</a>:
<blockquote>
<strong>Nokia Urges Linux Developers To Be Cool With DRM</strong>
<hr />
<a href="mailto:superglaze@hotmail.com">superglaze</a> writes in to note that according to Nokia's software chief, its plans for open source include getting developers to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jun2008/gb20080612_288518.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business">accept things like DRM, commercial IP rights, and SIM locks</a>.

«<a href="http://jaaksi.blogspot.com/">[Ari] Jaaksi</a> admitted that concepts like these "go against the open-source philosophy," but said they were necessary components of the current mobile industry.
"Why do we need closed vehicles? We do," he said.
"Some of these things harm the industry but they're here [as things stand]. These are touchy, emotional issues, but this dialogue is very much needed. As an industry, we plan to use open-source technologies, but we are not yet ready to play by the rules; but this needs to work the other way round too."»
</blockquote>

So, <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> wants to EAT using the knowledge and the software that the Open Source Community created... and, at the same time, change it's culture and impose concepts that are COMPLETELY against the Open Source "philosophy" itself. Interesting...
Instead of learning of the quality of what the Open Source community is capable of doing using a development model built around <strong>"equality and quality"</strong>, they want to teach/impose? And to who? To the <a href="http://trolltech.com/">Trolltech</a> employee? They are free to do so... but this does not mean that the rest of the Community will change its mind.
<a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">QT</a>? There is <a href="http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php">KDE that has a foundation to protect it</a> PLUS there is always <strong>the Fork option</strong> ;-) .
Think about <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> and <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/">X.org</a>: nowdays they lost all the users... because of the stupid decision of changing the license.

Sorry mates, this is not the right way. And now you are not the only player any more: still the biggest... but this is changing, and the Q4-2007 + Q1-2008 says that more than anything else.
