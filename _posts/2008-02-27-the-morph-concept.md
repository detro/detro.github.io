An impressive video from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia">Nokia</a> <a href="http://research.nokia.com/">Research Center</a>: it shows a concept technology called "Morph" based on the usage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology">NanoTechnology</a> for mobile devices (I feel that continue to call them "phones" is becoming very reductive).
