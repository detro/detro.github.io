This is a really amazing version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_H._Pink">Daniel H. Pink</a> speech about Motivation. It all into it's second book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594488843">Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</a>".
