<p>
This is my first post from a whole new backend. Yes, I'm leaving the underperforming and unreliable <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/" target="_blank">Bluehost Hosting</a> for a scalable, distributed, load-balanced, reliable, powerful platform. I'm going Google. I'm moving to <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank">App Engine</a>.
</p>
<p>
To make App Engine serve my purpose, I picked a small, cute, interesting project to do the job: <a href="http://github.com/Arachnid/bloggart" target=_blank">Bloggart</a>, made by brilliant <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/" target="_blank">Arachnid (Nick Johnson)</a>.
</p>
<p>
The old posts you ask? Yes, I'm working on a strategy for that. Most probably will work a bit on Bloggart to welcome my <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>'s data, and use the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadingdata.html" target="_blank">App Engine Bulk Loader</a>.
Of course, there will be quite few bumps on the way: Bloggart is not Wordpress. I'm sure there will be tons of features that will be left out. But Bloggart and App Engine suite my primary purpose: Speeeeeed. In fact, I recommend you take a good look at <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2009/10/Writing-a-blog-system-on-App-Engine" target="_blank">this series of article on Nick's blog</a> where he goes step-by-step through the development of his project: really cool stuff.

And now, back to coding: there is <strong>&gt; 6 years</strong> worth of blogging to import!
