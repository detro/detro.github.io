During <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/mwsf07/">the last MacWorld</a>, [en:Steve_Jobs|Jobs] presented the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>. I have nothing else to say about (the ENTIRE WORLD have already said enough): I have to share something <em>interest</em> only: the <a href="http://downloads.detronizator.org/iPhone Ring.mp3.bz2">iPhone Ring Tone</a>.

Now, My [en:N70] sounds VERY GOOD! ;)
