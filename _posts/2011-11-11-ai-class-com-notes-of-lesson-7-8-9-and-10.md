I have been very busy at home and in the weekend, so I'm a bit behind with study and sharing my notes.

I just finished going through the very interesting lesson 9, and I now have to start with lesson 10. I plan to do it on Saturday: tomorrow is a special night! ;-)

Instead, regarding lesson 8, I just managed to put down the list of topics discussed, but for lack of time I didn't put anything in writing just yet. Will eventually do it (maybe).

**UPDATE 12 Nov 2011:** I just finished putting down notes of Lesson 10. Very information dense, but I can see that Prof. Norvig went "easy" on us: [Reinforcement Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) could have taken way more time.

Also, those two lessons are all about [this guy below](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov): better you get down and really study [MDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process). This stuff will hit us back in during the exams.

**UPDATE 2:** I'd strongly suggest you go through [Mostafa Abedi's blog](http://mostafaabedi.wordpress.com/). His notes and examples can really help to "iron out" doubts.
