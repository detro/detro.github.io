Since now, Apple makes "only" good <a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/">howto</a> to make simple application, helping developers to learn our beauty technology: Apple calls these howtos "<a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/">Sample Code</a>". It was a good thing.
Sometimes, howtos was very very "advanced", using technologies too much difficult to understand in "few words". It was a bad thing.

Now...
<blockquote>The Apple Developer Connection is pleased to deliver "<a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/coredatatutorial/index.html">Building a Sample Core Data Application</a>," the first in a new series of tutorials that combine text with QuickTime video clips to demonstrate exactly how to work with key <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X Tiger</a> technologies. It's a new kind of technical resource, one that enables you to experience firsthand the powerful capabilities of development technologies such as <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/">Xcode 2</a>, Core Data, and Cocoa bindings.</blockquote>

<em><strong>Update Apr 2 2006:</strong></em> Done. 3 lines of code for:

<li>Document Based App</li>
<li>Spothlight integration</li>
<li>Save and Load features</li>
<li>Saving in XML, SQL and Binary format (?)</li>
<li>Apple look&amp;feel</li>
</ol>
O_O !!!
I haven't any words to explain my astonishment.
