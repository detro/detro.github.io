<img src="http://www.firstshowing.net/img/benjamin-button-booknew.jpg" alt="The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" align="right" width="150" />I hope <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421715/">the Movie</a> is better than <a href="http://www.anobii.com/books/The_Curious_Case_of_Benjamin_Button/9781416556053/01336c239bf35f6d63/">the Book</a>.

It's not a "bad book" in absolute values: it's bad because it doesn't follow it's own logic.
If you write the story of a man that, on the side of the age goes <strong>from Old to Young</strong>, and on the side of the body size goes <strong>from Small to Big</strong>... don't screw everything because you need to close the book in a "strange but appealing way".

I saw the trailer of the movie, and sounds like this is one of the rare case were <em>the Movie is better than the Book</em>.

Let's see.
