In August 2005 I was thinking about purchasing Apple quotes: $43/45 was a good price for my wallett ;) .

My Bank, instead, wants from me "things that I don't have" (other moneys) to allow me to operate on the US market.

Today is a good day but, if I had purchased some Apple quotes at that time, now I would be rich :cry: .

The title?
See at <a target="_new" href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/8206/">here</a> for comparation between Apple and Dell on US market.
<blockquote>On October 6, 1997, in response to the question of what he'd do if he was in charge of <a target="_new" href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> Computer, <a target="_new" href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a> founder and then CEO Michael Dell stood before a crowd of several thousand IT executives and answered flippantly, "What would I do? I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders."

A little more than a month later, on November 10, 1997, <a target="_new" href="http://www.pelagius.com/AppleRecon/971111_report.html">new Apple iCEO Steve Jobs responded</a>, speaking in front of an image of Michael Dell's bulls-eye covered face, "We're coming after you, you're in our sights."

Today, after a little more than eight years of hard work, Apple Computer, Inc. passed Dell, Inc. in market value. That's right, at market close <a target="_new" href="http://quotes.nasdaq.com/Quote.dll?symbol=AAPL&symbol=dell&mode=stock&multi.x=26&multi.y=4">Apple Computer ($72,132,428,843) is now worth more than Dell ($71,970,702,760)</a>.

Got any snappy retorts for that one, Mr. Dell?

Luckily, Apple has had the right man in charge since July 1997; a man with the vision and the ability to do what lesser men think impossible.</blockquote>
