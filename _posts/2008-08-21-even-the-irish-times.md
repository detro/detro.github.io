... knows <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2008/0814/1218477548932.html">what a knob/dickwad is Bondi</a>.

I would like to drive your attention to one particular sentence in the end:
<blockquote>...
Mr Bondi has, however, had nothing to say about the artistic merits of the "popular" entertainment that passes for serious broadcasting on the TV channels owned by his political master, Mr Berlusconi.
</blockquote>

This is not the first time I see how strong is the position of international news papers and media against the Quality of our TV: how ugly we look like? :(
