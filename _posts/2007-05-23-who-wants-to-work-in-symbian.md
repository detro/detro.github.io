Guys, it's time.
If someone want to apply, as Graduate or (better) as Professional... it is a pleasure for me to do.
Actually I'm thinking about:
- Alexa
- Faucho
- Ugo

Other good candidates, but that I think not interested are:
- SbatMan
- Biondo
- Eligio
- Nemo
- Ayor
- Luke

But, if someone wants to apply, let me know.
Go on <a href="http://www.symbian.com/about/careers/index.html">http://www.symbian.com/about/careers/index.html</a> for more details and vacancies. The Graduate program is the same I did... and can be a good idea for you too.

What do you need? To be:
- A good programmer
- Smart
- Understand and Speak a minimum of English
- C++, also basically (for Graduates)... but Intelligently (Do you see what I mean?)
- Understand a minimum of how an Operating System work

Let me know.
It's not a Joke: for you it can be future, for me can be Money (I ear up to Â£2000 if they take you ;) )

ps. This is ONLY for people that I know "physically", sorry ;)

<strong>Updated 2007-05-25</strong>: 
<ol>
<li>I forget to add Ayor and Luke.</li>
<li>The <strong>Graduate Program</strong> starts on <strong>September/October</strong>: just sign it on the Calendar, prepare a beautiful CV, study Symbian OS (I can give you details on books (and pdfs...)) and try Carbide.C++ 1.2 from the Nokia Website. I'll take you informed.</li></ol>
