I love this song.
It's just amazing: I loved it even before I read the Lyrics. And, actually, that's the incredible things: no one seems to be "sure" about what exactly is the mean. Someone says it's <a href="http://www.coldplaying.com/forum/showthread.php?t=44728">about Jesus</a> (quite unlikly from my point of view: to see Jesus in there you need to "stretch" the meaning). The other, more accredited belief, is that it's <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080525133756AACBH9u">about Napoleon</a> (the cover of the CD and a lot of what is said in the lyrics is adherent and coherent with this option).

But, as I said, I loved eat even before I read the full lyrics. It made me feel inspired. And made me think about love, life, my past, my present and my next leap. Probably more because of the great music and instruments than by the lyrics itself.
Well done <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay">Coldplay</a> ;)

... but, wait a minute! On Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_la_Vida_(song)">in the page about this album</a>, there is this section about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Martin">Chris Martin</a>:
<blockquote>
[...]
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_%28magazine%29">Q magazine</a> asked Chris Martin about the line "I know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter">Saint Peter</a> won't call my name" sung in "Viva la Vida". Martin replied: "It's aboutâ€¦ You're not on the list. I was a naughty boy. It's always fascinated me that idea of finishing your life and then being analyzed on it. And it's that runs through most religions. That's why people blow up buildings. Because they think they're going to get lots of virgins. I always feel like saying, Just join a band (laughs). That is the most frightening thing you could possibly say to somebody. Eternal damnation. I know about this stuff because I studied it. I was into it all. I know it. It's still mildly terrifying to me. And this is serious."

</blockquote>

So, looks like they are really into some religious message (or sort of it). Probably, just fascinated by the "figure" of Jesus himself.

Anyway, <strong>Enjoy!</strong> ;-)
