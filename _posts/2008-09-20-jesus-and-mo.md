I know I'll now have some problems for posting this, but I can't deny that it is VERY FUNNY!!! It's a blog, with daily comic-strips about a very particular "couple": <a href="http://www.jesusandmo.net/">Jesus and Mohammed</a>.

The blog is entitled: <a href="http://www.jesusandmo.net/">Jesus and Mo</a>. I was unable to find the name of the author (what a surprise), but I really don't care. Is he American, Saudi, Egyptian, Iraqi, Thai, Chinese or Napolitan? I really don't care, as long as the strips are smart and funny.

Here is a go(o)d one ;)
