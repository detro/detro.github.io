<a href="http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist2005.html">Here</a> is the "classifications" of the most requested things on Google web-search engine during the 2005.

Very interesting this:
<blockquote><strong>Google.com - Top Gainers of 2005</strong>
1. Myspace
2. Ares
3. Baidu
4. wikipedia
5. orkut
6. iTunes
7. Sky News
8. World of Warcraft
9. Green Day
10. Leonardo da Vinci
</blockquote>

Very notable (for me, obviously) are wikipedia (4), iTunes (6) and World of Warcrafs (8).
1) Wikipedia is demonstrating its power: a good idea that I hope never die.
2) iTunes is demonstrating the power of music-selling on-line
3) WoW: Amazing. The greatest game of the last years.
