Google finally <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2008/08/presenting-winners-of-android-developer.html">announced the winners of the First Round of the Android Developer Challenges</a>. There are 10 x $275,000 prizes and 10 x $100,000 prizes. <strong>$3,750,000 in prizes!!!</strong>. Not bad I must say.

There are some pretty cool apps, with a very clean and nice UI: demonstration of the power and flexibility of the Android Graphical Widgets Framework. Take a look at them in the <a href="http://code.google.com/android/adc_gallery/">official gallery</a>.

Congratulations to the Winners!!!
