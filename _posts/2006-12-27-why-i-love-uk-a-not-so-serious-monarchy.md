The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom">Queen</a> have started to make a series of <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5323.asp">Podcast about her Speeches</a>. This service is offered by the <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page3759.asp">British Monarchy Media Center</a>.

It's not so important, but this is a sing of the young of this Monarchy, with a big, rich and important story, but the ability to reorder and resync itself respect the changeing world.

Every English person does not see the Queen as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_power">Power</a>, but as a Symbol. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol">Symbol</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History">History</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition">Tradition</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance">Importance</a>.

Probably, My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Country</a> is richer about Symbol and History, but it's (and I'm, because I'm a part of it) not so smarty.
