Straightaway from <a href="http://osnews.com/story.php/18517/Ubuntu-Gutsy-Gibbon-7.10-New-Features/">OSNews.com</a>:
<blockquote>"This article will <a href="http://lunapark6.com/ubuntu-gutsy-gibbon-710-new-features.html">briefly discuss the new features found within Gutsy Gibbon</a> and hopefully give you a better idea of what to expect when the final version of Gutsy Gibbons is released in October. Some of the more notable new features are a Graphical Configuration tool for X, improvements in plug-in handling for Mozilla Firefox, revamped printing system with PDF printing by default, fast user switching, new desktop search (Tracker) application and the new AppArmor security framework."</blockquote>

Pretty cool!
