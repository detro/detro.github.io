<strong>Commander of the British Empire</strong>.

Queen Elizabeth II has inserted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive" title="John Ive on Wikipedia" target="_new">Johnathan Ive</a> in the <strong>New Year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" target="_new">Honours</a> list</strong> of Great Britain.

<blockquote>... He is widely seen as one of the key figures in Apple's resurrection.

Mr Ive started working for Apple in 1992 but exerted a big influence on its products only in 1997 when Steve Jobs returned to the company he co-founded.

Mr Ive's first design for Apple, the iMac, was hugely influential and has been followed by a series of other widely admired gadgets.</blockquote>
