<a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> is surprising me: I had tried <a href="http://www.joombla.com/">Joombla</a>, <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> and other minor CMS/Blog system. They was heavy to understand and to use. Too many "personalizations" and "features" that a "simple and with-no-time" user does not require.
I appreciate the use of very large characters in the administration interface, that evidence the interest of WP's developers to make "build a blog" simple.
WP offers, also, a simple way to make a personal web site, adding Pages and with the "feature" to do that gerarchically.
Finally I can make a personal blog and a personal homepage at the same time... without needs to understand an API framework or the strange and complex structure of a CMS.

When developer understands that make much to much features, does not means to make much to much simple software?
