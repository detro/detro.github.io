<em><strong>Taipei 101</strong>: The tallest building in the world since 2004</em>

This is my 101 days. Writing a post on the 100 (<a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2007/07/31/50-days-in-the-big-city/">50</a> * 2) was just too obvious ;) 

A lot of things are changed, and a lot are still changing. My life is stable like an Elephant on the point of a needle.

The <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Big City</a> has giving a lot to my "maturation process" as Software Engineer, but <em>it's not just gold because it sparkle</em>, is it? <strong>But it worth it</strong>. We come out of University thinking "we deserve the best", but we don't. At least, <strong>we don't yet</strong>. I'm figuring out, every day much more clearly, that University is just a gym, and whatever we did there, it is just not enough for the business world.

But this is a good thing, at the end of the day. I'm sure it should be nice to feel a genius, but is it "safe", is it "productive" for a young guy like me to have "everything and straightaway"? Not at all. Am a Spartan. I was born to fight. And I will.

Why not a post celebrating the "beauty" of <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a>? Because I'm not a business Man. I'm not The Suit-Guy. I'm not that kind of person.

Life goes on.
