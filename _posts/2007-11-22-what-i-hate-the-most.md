<strong>Edit 2007-11-23:</strong> Is it normal that my guy that sit on my right is cutting is nails? -_-

When a "person" makes a lot of <strong>unpleasant noise</strong> sipping his/her drink. Almost everytime it happens with hot drinks.
When a "person" produce a lot of <strong>strange sounds</strong> with his/her mouth chewing.
When a "person" <strong>fart and/or burp</strong> in public without begging for pardon.
... In general, I hate who is not <strong>well-mannered</strong>. At least, in public and/or in a place where not everyone is a close friend.

Probably will sound strange for people that know me personally, but I think is different when you make it "on proper/for fun" and when you are in that way.
