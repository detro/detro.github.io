<a href="http://www.redtacton.com/en/" target="_new">RedTacton</a> is developing a new technology to use the Human Body as a conductor to make Digital Device's Networks.

There are some application-field for that technology, like:

<blockquote>
- When a consumer stands in front of an advertising panel, advertising and information matching his or her attributes is automatically displayed.
- By touching or standing in front of items they are interested in, consumers can get more in-depth information.</blockquote>
or

<blockquote>
- By shaking hands, personal profile data can be exchanged between mobile terminals on the users. (Electronic exchange of business cards)
- Communication can be kept private using authentication and encryption technologies.</blockquote>

It's, obviously, a future application but ideas of RedTacton are very interesting: just think about the evolution (and the rationalization) of an advertising not invasive but "on demand"; or think about the possibility of exchange CV between two person in a conference, only with an hand shake.

... or about the direct file-exchange between friends ;).
