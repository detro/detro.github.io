Some scientists working on the <a href="http://lhc2008.web.cern.ch/lhc2008/">LHC</a> at the <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html">Cern of Geneva</a> had a cool idea to make people aware of "what" they are going to do. On the <strong>10th of September</strong> there will be the First Beam (more info on <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html">the official website/blog</a>), and I like the way they make sure people understand <strong>it's NOT the end of the World</strong>.

My personal answer to them is:
<blockquote>
Hey man, this shit is good! ;)
