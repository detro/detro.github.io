Hi.
This post is for any Londoner that is looking for a flatmate or a lodger... and that waste their time on my weblog ;) .

I'm looking for a <strong>long-term</strong> accomodation in [en:London]: a studio or a flat (also shared with max 3/4 people). I'm looking for something furnished, with 1 or 2 bathroom (for a better sharing), kitcken with all amenities, washer, fridge and so on. Better if renewed.

I'd like to be contacted by email for now, because I'm still in Italy. A view of the Accomodation could be sorted in March: I'll come for few (3/5) days for a briefing for my new job. It could be a good occasion. My schedule (to be confirmed) is:
<ul>
	<li>11th - available in the evening</li>

	<li>12th - available starting from 5/6 o'clock pm</li>

	<li>13th - available starting from 5/6 o'clock pm</li>

	<li>14th - available starting from 5/6 o'clock pm</li>

	<li>15th - available all day</li>

	<li>16th - available all day</li>

	<li>17th - available but under departure</li>
</ul>

Details on me follows. <!--more-->

I'll come beacuse a contract as Software Engineer in <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian Ltd.</a> And I predict to move finally the first days of April: I'd want to come a week before at least.

How to contact me?
Just comment this post: I'll recontact you as soon as possible (10 minutes ;) )!
