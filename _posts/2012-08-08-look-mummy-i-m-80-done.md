Let me give you a quick update about [GhostDriver](https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver), the [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) WebDriver implementation.

Yes, it's **80%** ready for prime time (bugs aside)!!!

How did I get from 40% to 80% so quickly? Because I decided that, for version 1.0, the commands that relate to the mobile web driver are out of scope. 1.1 or 1.2 will have them.

For details, I suggest you check out the [spreadsheet I'm using to track progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am63grtxc7bDdGNqX1ZPX2VoZlE2ZHZhd09lNDkzbkE) closely.

Some might call it "cheating". I call it "focusing".
