<strong>Title:</strong> Bill Gates: the last day at Microsoft.

I know that probably this is OLD, but... this is really funny! I have to say that [en:Bill Gates] surprised me for being so ironic about himself, his money and his power!
I still don't like you Bill, but at least you are better than big-fat-idiot-[en:Steve Ballmer].
