<blockquote>Although Intel only demonstrated its Robson (<a target="_new" href="http://www.vr-zone.com.sg/?i=2888">here a test</a>) cache technology in the fourth quarter of last year, <a target="_new" href="http://www.digitimes.com/NewsShow/MailHome.asp?datePublish=2006/1/5&pages=A5&seq=20">DigiTimes</a> is citing sources who claim that Apple Computer will launch a laptop in the middle of January that utilizes the NAND flash based cache memory technology.</blockquote>

Robson cache technology, which Intel demonstrated during the Intel Developer Forum Taipei this past October, relies on NAND flash instead of a traditional hard disk drive (HDD) for starting up a computer or launching frequently used applications. Some of the benefits of the technology are speedier computer boot time and improve battery life.

NAND seems to be the next evolution-leap of the non-volatile-memory technology: think about a computer with the hdd substituted with a flash memory. Really FAST! ;)
