Finally, I had a little amount of time to finish up my new theme.
<strong>Dheme</strong>: only a name for you, right now. But I want to make it downloadable in the future.

Actual version is 0.1: under heavy-development.

Dheme borns with 3 focuses: <strong>eye-candy</strong>, <strong>usability</strong>, <strong>richness</strong>.

Animations of Dheme are builded with the beautiful <a href="http://moofx.mad4milk.net/">moo.fx</a> library.

Do you like it? ;)
