Hi.
Can you help me?

I'm writing down a list of things that I have to bring with me for my "final move" in UK. I need an help: <strong>what do you'd put in your baggage for a light-move to another country?</strong>

Obviously, you can exclude everything that you'd bring for a normal "travel with return".

Every help will be appreciated! ;)
