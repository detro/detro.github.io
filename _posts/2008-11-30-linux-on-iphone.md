Of course, it was a matter of time: we all knew that. But, still, this video is important: a concrete, publicly understandable proof, that Linux is going on the iPhone.

Probably it will never have a concrete, commercial application (like running Android, as the guys from where I took the video would like ;) ), but it's undoubtedly an important proof of the great flexibility and adaptability of Linux and, in general, of the Open Source Software.

Way to go!

PS Yes, I'm very very busy (and, because of that, lazy) in the last period. Sorry!
