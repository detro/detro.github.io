This morning, while I was reading the <a href="http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/">Daniele Luttazzi's blog</a> and his series of post called <strong>"La Palestra"</strong> (<strong>"The Gym"</strong> in English), I decided that was worth it to translate some of the best I read.
"The Gym"? <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniele_Luttazzi">Luttazzi</a> publishes satyric jokes on his blog, from a collection of ones that he receives from his fans.
But why? Because I think some of them are good even in English. Italian's latest events are being publicized on international newspapers lately. This makes it possible to get those jokes.

There you go!
