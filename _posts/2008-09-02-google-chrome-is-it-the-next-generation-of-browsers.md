I don't have an answer to this, it's too early (we don't even have a screenshot of it). But I strongly suggest to take a look a the <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/">Google Chrome Comic Book</a>: a very new, fresh, funny and precise (!!!) way to introduce an incoming software.

They discuss a lot of different topics:
<ul>
	<li>Problems they wanted to solve</li>

	<li>Performance</li>

	<li>Process Isolation</li>

	<li>Javascript VM and Performance</li>

	<li>Sandboxing</li>

	<li>Phishing and Malware</li>

	<li>UI principles</li>
</ul>

Very interesting. And, again, very innovative.

Ah, the <strong>Rendering Engine</strong> they chosen is... <a href="http://webkit.org">WebKit</a> (what a surprise!!! ;-) ) and... it's fully open source.
