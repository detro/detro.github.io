I have already highlighted <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2008/02/06/piclens-pictures-in-a-cool-way/">in the past</a> this project. Now I'm delighted to report that version <strong>1.7 is out</strong>, and... it's a great one!!!

My favourite feature? Discover!
As soon as I installed the addon in <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/">Firefox</a> (very notable: it's <strong>already</strong> compatible with the brand new version 3 of my favourite browser), I spent something like 40 minutes just browsing the "movies/tv" section, full of very updated and interesting content... and presented in the most "sexy" way I have ever seen.

Again, a great piece of Software. <strong>Strongly recommended to give it a go!</strong>

PS Just to avoid to forget, Piclens works practically ANY browser ;) .
