<h3><a href="http://www.plextk.org/trac/wiki">Plex Toolkit</a></h3>
An XML+Javascript based toolkit that aims developer to make up very amazing interfaces, creating interface in XML format.
Can find demo <a href="http://www.plextk.org/trac/wiki/Demos">here</a>.

<h3><a href="http://qooxdoo.oss.schlund.de/">QooXDoo</a></h3>
<blockquote>QooXDoo is an advanced open-source JavaScript-based GUI toolkit. QooXDoo continues where simple HTML is not enough. This way qooxdoo can help you implement your AJAX-enhanced web 2.0 application - easier than ever before.</blockquote>
QooXDoo also seems to be a very interesting JS Framework to make up beauty interfaces.
Demo <a href="http://qooxdoo.oss.schlund.de/counter/refer.php?id=5">here</a>.

Ok, everything beauty, amazing, interesting, powerfull... bla bla bla.
But, using JavaScript!!!
The terrible-ungrammaticated-unportable language trapped in out browsers.

I think that in the future only "complete" solutions as <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2006/05/18/gwt-a-big-piece-of-code-by-big-g/">GWT</a>, that aims to write EXCLUSIVELLY Java Code, autogenerating JS code, becomes the MUST for Web-Apps development.
