Today is a great day ( :P ): I have added Google Page Rank calculation on the sidebar (&rarr;) of my weblog. It's possible thanks to the [en:PHP] class "<a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/2682.html">Google Page Rank Checker</a>" by <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/author/56578.html">Emre Odabas</a>, hosted on PHPClasses (the most important <strong>source-of-code-and-snippets</strong> for PHP Developers).

The class calculates "only" the integer value (between 1 and 10): the graphic representation is by me.

Actual Page Rank? <strong>5!!!</strong> O_o
