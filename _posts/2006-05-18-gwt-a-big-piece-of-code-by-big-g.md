<blockquote><strong>Google Web Toolkit - Build AJAX apps in the Java language</strong>

<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</a> is a Java software development framework that makes writing AJAX applications like Google Maps and Gmail easy for developers who don't speak browser quirks as a second language. Writing dynamic web applications today is a tedious and error-prone process; you spend 90% of your time working around subtle incompatabilities between web browsers and platforms, and JavaScript's lack of modularity makes sharing, testing, and reusing AJAX components difficult and fragile.

GWT lets you avoid many of these headaches while offering your users the same dynamic, standards-compliant experience. You write your front end in the Java programming language, and the GWT compiler converts your Java classes to browser-compliant JavaScript and HTML.</blockquote>

I have no time to test it now intensivelly (as you can see, I have no time even for this Blog!!! ;) ) but ideas behind it (and demos on the official web site) seems to be very interesting and very very cool for Web-2.0-ready and agile-development process, using Java.

The interesting features? IT'S UNDER APACHE LICENSE!!! :D
