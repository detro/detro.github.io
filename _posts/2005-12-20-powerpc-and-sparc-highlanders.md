Ok, also Apple does believes in PowerPC no more.
It seems that the future will be Intel-Based (ooooh my good!?!? what a joke? O_o), but the world is wide and the Tecnologies are much too much.

IBM and Sun, in similary way, are opening our tecnology (PowerPC and lastest Ultra Sparc, respectivelly) to the comunity (in particular, to Universitary comunity) to create (they hope) a large comunity of developer that are interest in study and development of this, in any case, big and powerfull platform (IMHO).
