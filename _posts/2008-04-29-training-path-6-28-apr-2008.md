This time I was running with Luca: we pushed a bit the speed... but we practically died at the end of Blackfriars Bridge: still good, but next time I need to slow down to last more.
Wish me good luck. I will run on the <a href="http://www.jpmorganchasecc.com/">JP Morgan Chase Corporate Challenge</a> on July ;)
