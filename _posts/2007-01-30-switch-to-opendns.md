<a title="Use OpenDNS to make your Internet faster, safer, and smarter." href="http://www.opendns.com/share/"><img src="http://images.opendns.com/buttons/use_opendns_155x52.gif" align="right" width="155" alt="Use OpenDNS" /></a> <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a>. A <strong>Safer</strong>, <strong>Faster</strong> and <strong>Smarter</strong> DNS network, open to any user: you only need to change your DNS configuration to:
<ul>
<li><code>208.67.222.222</code></li>
<li><code>208.67.220.220</code></li>
</ul>

If you need other info, take a look at <a href="http://www.opendns.com/faq/">the FAQ page</a>.

I experienced a speed improvement in name resolution and the <strong>anti-phishing system</strong> works great and transparently. It's a very good initiative.
