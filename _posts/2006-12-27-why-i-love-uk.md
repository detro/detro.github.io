It's not easy to explain... and I can't synthetize my motivations in a couple of words. Hence, I think it's a good idea to list, in a new series of post, the single facts one bye one.

I'm from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a> and the needs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service">service</a> and a bit of civilization is the main matter for me. I'm trying to change my life. I'm trying to come to live in the oldest "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy">Monarchy</a>" in the world.
