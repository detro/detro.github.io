This guy, <a href="http://www.moserware.com/">Jeff Moser</a>, is mental!
He made a <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2009/09/stick-figure-guide-to-advanced.html">loooong comic strip to make AES explain itself</a>: from a very high level, non technical explanation, deep down to mathematical details.

Worth a read for sure! ;)
