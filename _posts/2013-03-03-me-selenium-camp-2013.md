[Selenium Camp 2013](http://seleniumcamp.com/) has been a great experience. Not only I hanged out with great people, but, for the first time in my life, I also got to _savour_ a little bit of [Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine) in [Kiev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev).

VERY friendly people (really friendly). GREAT food. WELL-ORGANISED conference.

What else could I ask for?

### My talk

The title of my talk is **Getting Started with GhostDriver (and my experience working on it!)**.
