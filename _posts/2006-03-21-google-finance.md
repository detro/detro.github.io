Another AMAZING usage of Ajax by Google: <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance">Google Finance</a>.
It's obviously a "beta" and the home page does not seems to be very "ajaxed"... but <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=aapl&btnG=Search">try to find out a symbol</a> and... be prepared for WOW! 8O
