Ladies and Gentleman, this is the BEST Pizza I have ever (EVER!) eaten in my whole life!
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.accademiadellapizza.it/index.php"><img src="http://www.accademiadellapizza.it/images/header_sorbillo.jpg" alt="Sorbillo" width="400"/></a></div>

This Pizzeria, <a href="http://www.accademiadellapizza.it/index.php">Sorbillo</a>, is a family with a long History of "pizzaioli". From fathers to sons, they passed down the knowledge, the secrets of how to make the real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza#Pizza_types">Napolitan Pizza</a>.

Tonight I went there, completely unaware of where I was heading too: and I discovered the best pizza I have ever tried. This pizzeria also won the <strong>Prize of Best Pizza of the World</strong>! I don't know in which year, but most probably they are still the best.

I eat and strongly suggest the <strong>"Nonno Luigi - Pizza Sorbillo"</strong> (in english "<strong>Granpa Luigi - Sorbillo's Pizza</strong>"): a filled pizza that they first fry and then finish to cook in the oven. The ingredients were just SUPER! The best ingredients you could find in a napolitan pizza!

For tourists, friends or others: <strong>take my advice, go there and let me know! ;)</strong>
