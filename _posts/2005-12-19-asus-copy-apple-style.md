Hey, this is not a personalized version of Apple iBook!
No, it's:
<blockquote><strong>ASUS W6 Premium Edition Notebook </strong>Series "Reflects" Impeccable Taste in Digital Fashion.
Gloss Coated LCD Cover, Pearl White Housing with Gold Details Offer Superior Mobility with Style... </blockquote>

Taste in Digital Fashion???? O_o 
IT's the iBook PHOTOCOPY!!! It's a "without-shame" copy of the ORIGINAL, BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING Apple Style!

Asus, are you joke?
