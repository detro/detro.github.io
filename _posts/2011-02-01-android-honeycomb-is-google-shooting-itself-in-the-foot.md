This video is great! Yes, quality wise is quite poor, it looks like the [first movies from Pixar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar#Early_history). But it's quite amusing and "teasing". Take a second to watch it:

Definitely, Motorola is looking better and better at every new product ([even though their market share is still ridiculously small](http://gigaom.com/2010/05/17/droid-does-not-help-motorola-offset-market-share-loss/)). This video, with the whole set of products presented at [CES 2011](http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=ces+2011+motorola), like [Atrix 4G](http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-ATRIX-US-EN) and [Xoom](http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Tablets/ci.MOTOROLA-XOOM-US-EN.overview), is sign that they are ready to fight and fight hard.

Good for you Moto!

But, what I'm wondering about is the role of [Google's Android](http://developer.android.com/index.html) in all this.

Google is happily supporting multiple hardware manufacturers, giving them a very good, solid, reliable, flexible and customizable OS. It's a BIG DEAL. And it's looking like a convergence is happening there. Different brands are all going for the green robot: now and fast. From my point of view, it's great and expected: there was huge need for a modern (really modern! - yes, I'm looking at you [Symbian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian)) OS, that companies could take and make a phone out of it.

What's concerning is the Google's move between [2.2 "Froyo"](http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.2-highlights.html) &amp; [2.3 "Gingerbread"](http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.3-highlights.html), and [Android v3.0 "Honeycomb"](http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html). Why? Because it's destabilising. In a good and, for manufacturers, in a bad way.

Take Samsung: [Galaxy Tab](http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/01/31/just-kidding-samsung-galaxy-tab-sales-are-quite-small/) sales have been "small" and "uninteresting", market wise. But THAT product is actually the first Android Tablet. Why did it fail? Because it was _Android-made-for-smartphones_. Very true and... very sad for who actually spent the money.

But now "Honeycomb" is coming. It's great, it's for tablet and all that. Super-duper for gadgets-addict, but what about Samsung, that built a product doomed to failure?

Most probably, it has been a "Samsung choice" to take what was "available" from Google and make a Tablet out of it. I'm pretty sure Google mentioned them that _"they were working on a specific version for tablets"_. But Samsung made the mistake of building it anyway.

The question is: now, how can Samsung (and other manufacturers) feel confident with Android? How are they going to decide which version to pick? And when? Should they all depend on Google's word/work, and build their products only when Google says it's ready? Maybe yes, but are they happy to do so? Isn't this too much of a cross-company business dependency? That sounds bad to me...

I'm sure working for Google MUST BE GREAT, but trying to imagine the pressure coming from phone manufacturers, it must be a great deal of pain.

**PS Samsung Galaxy should be updated to Honeycomb!**
