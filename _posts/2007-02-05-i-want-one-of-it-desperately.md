First, the video from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/">TopGear</a>:

Title: <strong>Top Gear - <a href="http://www.carver-worldwide.com/">The Carver</a></strong>
Abstract: <strong>The carver is perhaps the greatest gadget and coolest less then 4 wheel vehical on the planet. </strong><strong>Vanderbrink</strong> (no way to find out this brand over the Internet) is the brand if you want to look it up. They are available in the US but are classified as a motorcycle which means you need a helmet. and thats just wrong.

It's INSANELY GREAT! Like a motocycle, but a car. Like a car, but a motocycle. It's also beauty and tiny (easy to park). I want one of it!
