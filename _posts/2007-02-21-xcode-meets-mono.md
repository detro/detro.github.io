And... seems to be a nice meeting. ;)
After a lot of development, the comunity surrounding the project realeases <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.3.1/">last stable version 1.2.3.1</a> of <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>.

What about [en:Mac_OS_X|Mac OS X]? <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:OSX">Here</a> is a <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:OSX">dedicated page on the official wiki of Mono</a>. And, in particular, I'm happy to highlight a <a href="http://mono-project.com/CSharpPlugin">tutorial/howto about XCode and Mono integration</a>: <a href="http://mono-project.com/CSharpPlugin">CSharpPlugin</a>.

I know that [en:Mono_(software)|Mono] is the open-source implementation of [en:.NET_Framework|.Net] (started by [en:Novell]), and that I hate [en:Microsoft|M$], but... I can't hate a framework. It's like to hate the [en:Plutonium] because we make the [en:Atomic_Bomb] with it! ;)

Besides:
	<ol>
<li>I have had a little experience with Mono (a [en:Gecko_(layout_engine)|Gecko#] and [en:GTK_Sharp|GTK#] based browser)... and it was very good. In particular, I like delegates very much.</li>

	<li>.Net and [en:C_Sharp|C#] specification are standardized at the [en:Ecma_International|ECMA]: it's one of the few times that M$ does things in the right way.</li></ol>
