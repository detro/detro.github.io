Every (almost) web site is say the same thing: today is a big day for the freedom (of the music and the customers). <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2007/02/07/drm-and-jobs/">The Jobs's tought is now reality</a>.
[en:EMI] (in the person of the CEO, Eric Nicoli) and [en:Steve_Jobs|Jobs], in a live blogging on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/02/steve-jobs-and-emi-present-an-exciting-new-digital-offering/">Engadget</a>, announce that, starting on May 2007, <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> (and, probably, any other EMI music reseller) will sell music without any DRM</strong>.

Details can be found on:

Only other 2 words: 
<ul>
<li>the quality is higher (256kb/s) but also the price ($1.29 per song). Instead, the price of the videos will remain the same ($1.99 per video). Not so good for the little wallets, but the first step in the good direction.</li>

<li>And, what about other majors? Actually, no other majors has joined "<strong>this big step forward</strong>" but, as Jobs has said a lot of time, &laquo;<strong><em>Someone makes history, the others simply follow</em></strong>&raquo;.</li></ul>
