Ok ok ok.
You already know very well that URLs but... I don't. Want's to kill me? :(
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jef.raskincenter.org/home/index.html">Jef Raskin web page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/steve/Resume.html">Steve Jobs CV (and homepage on .Mac)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.woz.org/">Steve Wozniak</a></li>
</ul>

The page of Jobs looks like a "by-hand-personally-work": if you take a look of the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/steve/iMovieTheater31.html">movies</a>, you can understand with what software he make them.

On the Raskin page (you know he's dead? I already know :P) there is a link to the much too much interesting <a href="http://rchi.raskincenter.org/aboutrchi/index.php">Project Archy</a>: this project seems to be the realization of the things in his book <em>The Humane Interface</em> (Addison-Wesley 2000).
I promise I'll take a look at this and will spend my two cents on it.
