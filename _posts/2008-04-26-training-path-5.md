<strong>2.05 miles ~= 3.3 kms</strong>

Today I took it a bit easy: John was with me and he has a problem with his knee, so we decided to do only 2 miles to start.
Very beautiful day: looks like full summer, with a very strong sun smiling to us.
We passed through a big festival/party/something in South Bank: a lot of people enjoying ice creams, watching shows and other stuff for kids. I tried to google for it, but I didn't manage to know what's going on up there.
