A video that I need to watch myself (I just managed to watch 25% of it), but I thought was good to post it here: just to remind how good it is to think "out of the box". Even in Programming Languages.

<blockquote>
Go is a new experimental systems programming language intended to make software development fast. Our goal is that a major Google binary should be buildable in a few seconds on a single machine. The language is concurrent, garbage-collected, and requires explicit declaration of dependencies. Simple syntax and a clean type system support a number of programming styles.

For more on Go including FAQs, source code, libraries, and tutorials, please see:<a href="http://golang.org">http://golang.org</a>
