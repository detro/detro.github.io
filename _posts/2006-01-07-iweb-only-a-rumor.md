<blockquote>Just before noon on Thursday, the company's Garageband and Support websites displayed links to non-existent iLife '06 product pages and listed "iWeb" as one of its included applications. Released <a target="_new" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=828">last year</a> at Macworld Expo in San Francisco, iLife '05 -- the current version of the suite -- includes only iPhoto, iDVD, iMovie, GarageBand, and iTunes.

Sources had previously told AppleInsider that Apple was preparing to introduce a new Web design application during <a target="_new" href="http://www.macworldexpo.com/live/20/">next week's Macworld Expo</a>, which would integrate with the company's .Mac suite of Internet services.</blockquote>

I think is too difficult to make an application to edit and publish webpages without the necessary skills. But, I know the Apple-style, and Apple know how to make easy the difficultest missions... (think at <a target="_new" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/idvd/">iDVD</a>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a> and other products of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/" target="_new">iLife Suite</a>)
