<img src="http://riceball.com/drupal/files/rotatingclock-fast.gif" alt="Busy Icon" align="right" /> No, I'm not Dead. I'm just "very Busy" guys ;)
A lot of things are happening at the same time: as soon as I have more time I'll speak about it.

I'll just make a list of things I would like to speak about... if I would have time to do so:
<ul>
<li>My new Job in <strong>France Telecom R&D UK - Orange Labs</strong> and my work inside the Source of Webkit (and a bit of Opera)</li>

<li>The fact that <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/columns/josephnocera/?inline=nyt-per">Joe Nocera</a> was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/26/business/26nocera.html?_r=2&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin&oref=slogin">finally kicked in his balls by a proud Steve Jobs</a> about his health</li>

<li>Symbian going Open Source AND some (stupid?) rumors about <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/business/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=209600592">Symbian "merging"</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/25/AR2008072502176.html">with Android</a></li>

<li>My aiming to buy a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000U1H0XY/ref=ord_cart_shr?_encoding=UTF8&m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE">Samsung SM2032MW 20" Widescreen TV Monitor- Black</a> (that supports HDMI, DVI, RGB, SCART, 1080p/i and so on... (yes, for a [en:Play_Station_3|PS3] ;) ) )</li></ul>

But... I'll just keep doing what I'm doing.
See you soon ;)
