Hi. I don't know if you can notice it, but I just did few updates to the CSS of this Blog.

<div class="img">
<img src="http://sleep-deprivation-symptoms.org/wp-content/uploads/Sleep-Deprivation-Symptoms-1.jpg" />
Effects of sleep deprivation (no, I'm not THAT tired)
</div>

If you are one of the few a followers of [my Bloggart fork](https://github.com/detro/bloggart), you know what's going on: Page support, changes to the **"Squared"** theme and more.

I'm not yet where I want to be, but it's getting closer. While I add small features to Bloggart, I learn its intricacies, and discover some small/medium latent bugs. Stuff that _"didn't happen because scenario x was never considered"_: this is giving me some possibilities to fix and improve.

I believe now Bloggart does a slightly better job using the [App Engine Deferred API](http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/deferred.html). It's not much, but makes you feel like you are making some use of the Google-Cloud Power. Nice to have.

My theme, **"Squared"**, is getting better, thanks mainly to the advices of the CSS-Master [ekynoxe](http://blog.ekynoxe.com/). His advices are very helpful and illuminating: I know very few developers that have such a great talent for design and "ability to explain themselves". **Thanks mate!**

Stay tuned: more is coming.
Is just a matter of depriving myself of sleep hours, not a big deal...
