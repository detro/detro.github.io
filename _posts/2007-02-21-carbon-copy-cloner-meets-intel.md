This means that now it runs on [en:MacIntel] too. But, what's new in <a href="http://www.bombich.com/software/docs/CCCHelp/top/whatsnew.html">this beta release</a>? <!--more-->

<blockquote>
Carbon Copy Cloner 3 was completely rebuilt from the ground up to bring a new suite of features to meet the growing needs of Mac OS X users. In addition to the fast disk-to-disk cloning, CCC is now a full-featured backup utility as well.

Among the new features in CCC 3 are:
			<ul id="naked_list">
				<li><p>Support for block-level disk-to-disk clones.</p></li>
				<li><p>Support for backing up across the network.</p></li>
				<li><p>The ability to drill down into folders to select exactly what gets copied and what doesn't (you can drill down indefinitely).</p></li>
				<li><p>A more responsive interface and the ability to stop the clone.</p></li>
				<li><p>More accurate feedback during the clone.</p></li>
				<li><p>The ability to pick up where a previously aborted backup task left off.</p></li>
				<li><p>More information about your disks are available within the CCC interface.</p></li>
				<li><p>Advanced scheduling capabilities -- choose what days to run your backups and how frequently they should run. You can also defer a 
				backup if it starts at an inopportune time.</p></li>
				<li><p>Now you can create a scheduled task that backs up your data whenever you attach a specific hard drive or iPod.</p></li>
			</ul></blockquote>
