Update for the new <strong>"D"heme</strong> of this/my homepage/blog.
	<ol>
<li>New <code>:hover</code> style for the <code>h3</code> header of sliding <code>div</code></li>
<li>Added the class <code>img.wp-smiley</code> for smiles in posts</li>
<li>I have enlarged the left column and  restricted the center column</li>
<li>Added a nice background for the <code>blockquote</code> element</li>
</ol>

What it lacks?
Primary, a admin menu using the style of the "Credits toggle" on the bottom (had you seen it, don't you? ;) )
