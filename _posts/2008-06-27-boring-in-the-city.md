I watched 3 minutes of Sex and the City (the Movie) and... I want to cut my throat an close myself in jail to avoid to have to suffer so much in life... again.

<div align="center"><strong>HOW THE FUCK WOMAN WATCH THIS IMMENSE, BREATH-TAKING, OVERSIZED, HORRIFYING AMOUNT OF CRAP?!?!?!</strong></div>

In 3 minutes there was only few concepts:
We, as woman, are:
<ul>
<li>Stupid</li>
<li>Always looking for the right rich Man to pay for us all the stupid exaggeration we love</li>
<li>Very Stupid</li>
<li>Beautiful (but we just think so...)</li>
<li>Easy to Buy by Words</li>
<li>Very, very Stupid</li>
</ul>

Every woman should be ashamed to watch stuff like that. Seriously.
