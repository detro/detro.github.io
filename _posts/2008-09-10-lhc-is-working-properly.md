<strong>Today, 10th of September 2008</strong>, the final, complete, clock and anti-clock wise test of the <a href="http://lhc2008.web.cern.ch/lhc2008">Large Hadron Collider</a> was a major success. The <a href="http://lhc2008.web.cern.ch/lhc2008/">LHC </a>is working and ready to start to "crash protons"... and probably <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2008/09/06/large-hadron-collider-goes-rap/"><em>blow up your (our all) mind</em></a> ;) .
