WOW!
I mean... <strong style="font-size: 150%; ">WOW!</strong>
Look at what people are doing using the power of HTML5 + a very fast Javascript Engine!

<div align="center"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/aZo-Uv7TZs8&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/aZo-Uv7TZs8&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></div>

Those experiments are collected here: <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/">Chrome Experiments</a> (note the subtitle: "<em>Not your mother's JavaScript</em>" - LOL).

Bear in mind: this is <em>not only</em> because of <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> itself. This is the power of <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-canvas-element">HTML5 Canvas element</a>, plus, of couse, the very (very) fast <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8 Javascript engine</a>). And indeed, I ran them on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html">Safari 4 beta</a> without a glitch: the Javascript engine, <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/214/introducing-squirrelfish-extreme/">SquirrelFish Extreme (SFX)</a> is pretty good too.

I knew <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">HTML5</a> is gonna be BIG, but I never thought "that BIG". Not in terms of <em>"it's not doable"</em> but in terms of<em> "who can be that mad to do it!!!"</em> :D
Evidently, there are a lot of "maddos" out there ;)
