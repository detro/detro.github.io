I still haven't tested it, but I will soon (<del datetime="2006-03-26T12:20:10+00:00">activation email still not arrives... :( </del>). If it's as I think, it can be a revolution in SOHO (I hope JS it's not heavy for my "little" iBook :D ).

<strong>Update 01:</strong> no email activation needed :P
<strong>Update 02:</strong> a color-full, nice and funny environment with many applications. It is a beta software, but seems to be stable and features-rich. Applications like calculator, pac-man-applets, browser ( ;) ), sticky-notes, contacts book, the basket trash... everyone with a beautifull style.
