Recently the online class "[Introduction to Artificial Intelligente](https://www.ai-class.com/)" has began. [Prof. Sebastian Thrun](https://www.ai-class.com/) and [Prof. Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/), from [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/), are offering it for free. And I'm enjoying every minute of it.

The idea is to trasport to the web [the same course that they are teaching in person at Stanford](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/). Almost simultaneously.

One of the great notes from [larvecode](http://larvecode.tumblr.com/tagged/ai-class).

It's in my opinion a **great experiment**: there are **160,000 students**, and will be interesting to see how it pans out. The two profs are doing their best to _"leverage the scalability of the web"_, instead of trying to retrofit the web into the class. That is smart. And gives them more chances of success.

Anyway, if you are interested to know more, I gave you the links above. Check it out if you are into this kind of stuff.

Here I only want to signal a couple of links I'm sharing: my notes for [Lesson 1](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/5a5f0750-5afd-4aa8-89b3-f1415dee4d00/a5ba70b87bcaee6cddb409632a9bba4d) and [Lesson 2](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/42ff5536-31af-4dd0-a0e8-7d17e38b62f1/d89e4cbd0fd75ba1ace59cab1a3b7182). I'm using [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) to take the notes, and that makes it really easy to share. I also have notes with my solution of the first Homework assignment... but I have to hold on to that, as the [Stanford Code of Conduct](http://institutionalcompliance.stanford.edu/conduct/) requires me to wait for the profs to publish the solutions first (that will happen this Sunday 16th of Ocober at 23:59 UTC).

In my notes I also imported some of [the great notes/pictures/drawing from larvecode](http://larvecode.tumblr.com/tagged/ai-class). Very cool stuff!
