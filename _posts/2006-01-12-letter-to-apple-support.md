Hello,

I purchased a new Powerbook three weeks ago. It was working fine until a few hours ago when you announced the new Intel-powered MacBook Pro at MacWorld and I started to cry. "Four to fives times faster," I sobbed, "a built-in iSight, and a brighter, wider screen."</em>...</blockquote>

This Apple User purchased a <a target="_new" href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">new Powerbook</a> but, because of the lauch of MacBook Pro, now he say at Apple Care "can you send me a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> as a replacement, please?"

Poor Guy, ONLY a PowerBook. ;) ( :evil: )
