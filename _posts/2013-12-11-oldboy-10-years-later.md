It was 10 years ago. A night just like this one. Winter. Everyone in the house
was asleep (well, Leonardo isn't really sleeping right now but you get the idea).
I was alone in the kitchen. Alone with the TV and a `.avi` and a `.srt`.

I had just started watching movies in foreign language and during the week I had
stumbled upon "Old Boy".

The title was in English: how was I supposed to know it was a movie from
South Korea?

I remember being captured very quickly by the story. It was intriguing, cruel,
nightmare-ish. Just the kind of stuff that tingles me. The actor looked like
Jackie Chan, but much better at acting.

I just finished watching it again. Now I got a `.mkv`, and the subtitles are a
track in it, but the greatness of this movie comes back to mind.

Luckly I had almost entirely forgotten the story, so I have enjoyed it all over
again. But it's funny: 10 years later you see new details - you notice new scenes,
new details you had missed, new characters even.

Same exact movie: what is changed is me. In 10 years SO MUCH has changed.
10 years ago I had not even met my lovely wife. I knew I wanted to leave the
limited south of Italy, but I didn't know I could actually do it. I didn't know
that the next time me and this movie would meet, I'd be living a completely new
life. With a wife and a son - my own little family that is just starting.

Every New Year's Eve I look back at the year, make a mental list of what changed,
"where am I now". And I enjoy thinking that, next year, I'll be somewhere else
again with my life.

Maybe in 10 years, 2023, I should find again this long lost friend of a movie,
and watch it again. What the hell! I will definitely do that. Let's just hope
I don't change too much and forget to do it.

Maybe, in 10 years, my son will join me. Well, he will be 10 and this movie
will be probably too "gruesome" for him - let's say he will have to wait 20
years than.

Time. You bastard. How do you go so fast?
