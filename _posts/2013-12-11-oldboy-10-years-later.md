It was 10 years ago. A night just like this one. Winter. Everyone in the house
was asleep. Well, Leonardo isn't really sleeping right now but you get the idea.
I was alone in the kitchen. Alone with the TV, an `.avi` file and an `.srt` file.

I had just started watching movies in foreign language and during the week I had
stumbled upon [Old Boy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/).
I wasn't really in the mode of staying up late, but something made me.

The title was in English: how was I supposed to know it was a movie from
South Korea? I know, I was _very na√Øve_.

I remember being captured very quickly by the story. It was intriguing, cruel,
nightmare-ish. Just the kind of stuff that tingles me. The main actor,
[Min-sik Choi](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158856/),
looked a lot like [Jackie Chan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329/),
but much better at acting.

I just finished watching it again. Now I got a `.mkv`, and the subtitles are a
track in it, but the greatness of this movie comes back to mind.

**Luckly I had almost entirely forgotten the story, so I have enjoyed it all over
again**. But it's funny: 10 years later you see new details - you notice new scenes,
new details you had missed, new characters even. I had totally forgot about the
way he gets released and the first guy with the dog that
he meets once he is back in the world.

Same exact movie: what is changed is me. In 10 years SO MUCH has changed.
10 years ago I had not met yet my lovely wife. I knew I wanted to leave the
limiting life of the south of Italy, but I didn't know I could actually do it.
I didn't know that the next time me and this movie would meet,
I'd be living a completely new life.
With a beautiful wife and a beautiful son - my own little family that
is just starting.

Every New Year's Eve I look back at the year, make a mental list of what changed,
_"where am I now"_. I enjoy thinking that, next year, I'll be somewhere else
again with my life. _How exciting!_

Maybe in 10 years, 2023, I should find again this long lost friend of a movie,
and watch it again. What the hell! I will definitely do that. Let's just hope
I don't change too much and forget to do it.

Maybe in 10 years, my son will join me. Well, he will be 10 and this movie
will be probably too _"gruesome"_ for him - let's say he will have to wait 20
years instead...

**Time**. You bastard. How do you go so fast?

# P.S.

Yes, I know that
[Spike Lee's "new" Oldboy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321511/)
has just been released, but that's an almost total coincidence.
I'm going to eventually watch this _USA edition_, but I don't expect it to make
me happy - remakes are usually badly executed.
Still, the actors involved are very good so I don't expect to be disappointed either.
