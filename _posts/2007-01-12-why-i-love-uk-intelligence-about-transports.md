In <strong>England</strong>, in <strong>Bristol</strong> and <strong>Leeds</strong> Town, an experiment is underway: normal Cars can take the <strong>bus and taxi fast lane</strong> if it carry one or more passengers. It's called "car pooling" and it aims to grow-up the ratio people/car.

Probably this experiment will fail because a great number of families are "<em>nuclear</em>", with one, two or, at maximum, three components. But, at this real moment, the Halls of the two cities speak about a sensible trip-time reduction.

Good luck to Bristol and Leeds.
