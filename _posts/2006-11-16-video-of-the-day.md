Title: <strong>Microsoft, Wake Up and Smell Defeat!</strong>
Abstract: <strong>Craig bemoans the fate of the newly released "iPod killer".</strong>
</blockquote>

Zune, launched on the market few days ago, is getting only bad reviews and comments, and it's the target of every show-man in the USA.
I'm not surprised about this: Zune have NO APPEAL!!! Look at EVERY iPod: the Apple's product is so... sexy ;)
About the Zune features? Oh sure, they are amazing: but do you really think this is a very good motivation to prefer it instead of iPod? With the new "iPod Touchscreen" under-development?
