Migration to <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/">BlueHost</a> done. I just lost all my [en:Page Rank] O_o

<div align="center">
<img src="http://hosting.piry.net/bh/logo.jpg" alt="BlueHost Logo" />
</div>

I don't understand why, but the <ins datetime="2008-02-14T23:04:05+00:00">only</ins> time interval without service was yesterday night: how is it possible?

Anyway, now we are on a new Hosting Service: soon also the [en:DNS] will be migrated accordingly ;)
