Hypothetical new logos: <a title="new intel logo hypo" target="_blank" href="http://www.matbe.com/images/biblio/divers/000000022934.png">here</a>.

Hypothetical new slogan: <span class="testoarticolo">Intel, leap ahead</span>.

Eric Kim, Marketing CEO of Intel, say:
<blockquote>Simple expression that highlights who we are and where we go.</blockquote>
In <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macitynet.it/macity/aA23438/index.shtml">this article (in italian) on MacCity</a> there are some other informations about this "revolution": the Pentium name will die. Names like "Core Solo" or "Core Duo" will be the news.

Read the article above for more details.

IMHO, Apple will not use the Intel logo on the future MacTel machines... I hope :|.
