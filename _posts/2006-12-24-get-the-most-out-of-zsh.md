Taking a walk for <a href="http://www.ossblog.it/post/1681/zsh-senza-limiti">one of my preferred blogs</a> I found an <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-satzsh.html?ca=dnw-745">interesting article from IBM DeveloperWorks: "Get the most out of zsh"</a>.
I did't know this shell until now and, reading the article, I was convinced to give it a try.

<code>icebook# sudo apt-get install zsh</code>
