I went inside the store (<a href="http://www.halfords.com/">www.halfords.com</a>) to choose a Town&Trial Bike (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touring_bicycle">Touring Byke</a>): just because I have to go around "a city".

But when I saw her I forgot about any "stupid-little-tiny-weels-bike" and just loved her at first sight!

I'll go to bring her with me on Sunday: we will go around London just for fun.
I hope we will stay together forever.
And that she will like my weight.
And...

Ok, I have demonstrated that I'm crazy. It's enough! :D
