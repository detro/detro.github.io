Few days ago I had changed the subtitle of my [en:weblog]
<blockquote>

Consider yourself Perfectible makes you Perfect!

</blockquote>

It's not about me... or, better, it's not ONLY about me. It's about EVERYTHING. About Countries too. What it means? Follow me...

Today I have listened (and <a href="http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page10934.asp">readed</a>) this podcast entitled "<a href="http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page10617.asp">PM (Prime Minister) and Stephen Fry reflect on modern Britishness</a>": it's the newest podcast from the website of <a href="http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/page1.asp">10, Downing Street</a>. I have discovered it also, after <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2006/12/27/why-i-love-uk-a-not-so-serious-monarchy/">the one about the Queen</a>.

As you can see, it's an interesting discussion between [en:Tony_Blair|Tony Blair] and the great [en:Stephen_Fry|Stephen Fry] about the Culture, the Morals, the Multi-Culturalism and the last-10-years Growth of the [en:United_Kingdom|UK].

The discussion go through the various arguments not in a extremelly formal way, but with "A Bit of Humor" (in particular thanks to Fry ;) ), demonstrating the capaciousness of the PM too of "[en:Take_it_Easy|take it easy]".

In my opinion, it does not fall in banality but, instead, demonstrates the attention of the UK's Institution regards new technology, youth's needs and the weight to be a country where "people want to come to live". Fry and Blair, indisputably proud to be British, don't forget to remember and underline "what remains to do"; to highlight that "they are not perfect".

But, I'm not looking for a perfect country: I'm looking for <strong>something like [en:United_Kingdom|this]!. A Country that </strong><strong>TAKE CARE OF ME</strong>!

p.s. What's? About the title? British friends probably remember [en:A_Bit_of_Fry_and_Laurie|Stephen and Hugh], do they not?
p.p.s. <strong>Thank you to Lelly</strong>: the sentence "<em>Consider yourself Perfectible makes you Perfect</em>" was created during a conversation between us. The original version was in Italian:
<blockquote>

Ritenersi Perfettibili Rende Perfetti!
