<a href="http://static.popcap.com/iphone/">This version of Bejeweled</a> is available for free as Ajax implementation. And it is a good way to waste your work-time ;) .
Originally thinked to run on [en:iPhone], it is quite good also on [en:Firefox] (I haven't tried on [en:Internet_Explorer|IE]).

Enjoy!

<strong>What?</strong> Sorry, if you, like me until this morning, don't know <em>what the hell</em> is this game, here is a piece of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bejeweled">dedicated Wikipedia page</a>:
<blockquote>
<strong>History</strong>

Initially it was created by PopCap Games as a web-based Flash game called Diamond Mine. The game was an incredible success for PopCap, which had only formed in 2000. PopCap created partnerships with well established Internet gaming sites such as Microsoft Zone to host Bejeweled as well. The game has also been ported to other platforms, including Bejeweled Deluxe for Microsoft Windows. Astraware produced Bejeweled for PDAs on the Palm OS, PocketPC and Smartphone platforms. They also released Bejeweled Deluxe on the Xbox as a downloadable Xbox Live Arcade game. On September 12, 2006, it was released as one of the first games downloadable from the iTunes Store for the Apple iPod.

Recently, skill games like Bejeweled have been retooled for head-to-head gaming sites like SkillJam and WorldWinner. Players can play in "vs." games for cash prizes or join tournaments.
