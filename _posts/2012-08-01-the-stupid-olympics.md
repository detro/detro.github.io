I'm baffled on how stupid the British officials and politicians are. The entire show, is as bad in practice as it looks good on TV.

* Business _starving_ for customers in Central London
* No one has tickets: either because are too expensive or because buying tickets was a Olympic sport on it's own
* Empty stations and entire city areas because of TfL _end-of-the-world-is-night_ emails
* Trains, somehow, still managed to get fucked up and cancelled

Was all this on purpose?
