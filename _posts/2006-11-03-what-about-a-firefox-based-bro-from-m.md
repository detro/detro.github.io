<strong>It's Microsoft(R) Firefox 2007 Professional!!!</strong>
The new award-winning browser from Microsoft is now faster, securer and quicker anything else on the market. Why use anything else? ;)

This is a Joke, obviously, but what do you think about a new Bro based on our lovelly Fox... from Bill? I don't think it can be a future... and there are license problem, also.
