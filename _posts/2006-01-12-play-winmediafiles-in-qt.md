Microsoft, because of the STOP to development of <a target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=windowsmedia">Windows Media Player for MacOSX</a>, make a <a target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/flip4mac.mspx">page</a> on our site where we can download a nice thing: a plugin for QuickTime aims to view Windows Media Files.

Seems to be a good product: I will update you soon.

The plugin is <a target="_new" href="http://www.flip4mac.com/wmv_upgrades.htm">Flip4Mac</a>. The company behind this piece of code is Telestream, that <a target="_new" href="http://www.flip4mac.com/wmv_upgrades.htm">sell other plugins to import/edit WMF</a>.

I have a question: <a target="_new" href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/06/news/newsmakers/worldswealthiestupdate/">M$ is the richest company in the World</a> and... needs third-part plugin to make our file-formats viewable on MacOSX? It's a Joke? :| ( :lol: )
