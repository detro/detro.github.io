<blockquote>More and more people are buying and loving Macs. To make this choice simply irresistible, Apple will include technology in the next major release of Mac OS X, Leopard, that lets you install and run the Windows XP operating system on your Mac. Called Boot Camp (for now), you can download a public beta today.</blockquote>

I think its a great idea: supporting directly Windows on Apple Intel computers aims Users to become MacOSX users easly. First buy a MacIntel, then install the 2 systems and "try both 2 worlds"... what's the result? New MacOSX-lovers. I'm sure ;) .

<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Here</a> the Boot Camp official page; <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303572">here</a> the related FAQ.

A little curiosity: please, read "comments" and "notes" on the bottom and the right side of the page. :D Example?
<blockquote><em><strong>EFI and BIOS</strong></em>

Macs use an ultra-modern industry standard technology called EFI to handle booting. Sadly, Windows XP, and even the upcoming Vista, are stuck in the 1980s with old-fashioned BIOS. But with Boot Camp, the Mac can operate smoothly in both centuries.</blockquote>

Why Boot Camp does not support other systems (like the beautiful Penguin)? <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2006/02/16/gentoo-the-mactel-linux-project/">Here the answer</a>.
