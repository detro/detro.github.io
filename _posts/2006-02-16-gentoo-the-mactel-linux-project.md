I was one of the first Gentoo-on-iBook-7450 installer: I have an idea of the obstacles that Apple make (voluntarily?) to stop the "waste" of our hardware.

The installation of <a href="http://xbox-linux.org/mactel/index.php/Main_Page">Gentoo on Mactel</a> is only a "time issue": <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Firmware_Interface">EFI</a> was, for me, the biggest problem (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/elilo">elilo</a> rulez!). But I don't know the internal hardware of that new machine.

Anyway, Good Work guys.
