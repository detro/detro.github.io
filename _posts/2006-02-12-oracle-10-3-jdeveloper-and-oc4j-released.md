I'm not an <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/index.html">Oracle developer</a>. I'm not an Oracle DB Manager. I'm not an Oracle Java Developer.
I'm an Eclipse lover since <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse 3.0M*</a> releases but, because of the power of Oracle, I had ever followed our development in the Java-Development-World.

5 days ago I Oracle sent to me information the release of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/collateral/1013newfeatures.htm">JDeveloper 10.3</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/oc4j/index.html">OC4J 10.3 (Oracle Container for Java - our Application Server)</a>, and today I spent a little amount of time looking at the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/collateral/1013newfeatures.htm">new features of JDeveloper</a> and looking the interesting <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/viewlets/viewlet.html">flash-screencast-demos</a>.

Obviously, these product are available for Linux, Windows, MacOSX and... any Java-Enabled systems.

It seems to be very interesting software: ok ok, it's not  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a>... but it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis">Free (of cost)</a> and it's very powerfull.
I <strong>strongly</strong> suggest to give it a chance!.

And, if you don't know it, Oracle is an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/membership/members/add_in_provider.php">Eclipse Add-In Provider</a> and it's not impossible to have a plugin Eclipse produced directly from Oracle.

Update: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/htdocs/faq_adffaces_apache.html?msgid=4589089">Oracle's ADF Faces donation to Apache</a>. Oracle is not completelly indifferent respect the OpenSource. It's not?
