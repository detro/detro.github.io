This is the first official release of a new project, JPound:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jpound/"><strong>JPound</strong></a> is a Control and Configuration System for Asterisk PBX

Based on the ARA (Asterisk Realtime Architecture) and builded with DB-Centric-Systems in mind, JPound is a young but powerful (I hope ;)) idea to make Asterisk a complete, manageable, extensible, flexible Phone System.

Actually, JPound version is 1.0 stable.

The main structure is good defined and it seems to be solid but extensible.
I have many idea about future services and expansions: it's a 'testing-the-field' release.
