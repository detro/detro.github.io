Today, after <a href="http://blog.neminis.org/fin-dove-riesci-a-contare.html#comment-8911">finishing</a> of the <a href="http://0.xmau.com/">URL-game</a> of <a href="http://xmau.com">xmau</a> (I have jumped the 42 because... I don't know how to make <a href="http://www.google.it/search?q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything">THE QUESTION</a>: I have found the credits casually! ;) ), I have decided to come back to life.

And, on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/03/02/vmware-fusion-beta-2-with-experimental-3d-graphics/">TUAW</a>, I found this: <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> release the beta 2 of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/beta/fusion/">Fusion, the [en:Mac_OS_X|MacOSX] version of VMWare Virtualization System</a>.

The biggest news is the availability of the native 3D-Support of DirectX for virtualized [en:Windows] installations.

<a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/beta/fusion/releasenotes_fusion.html">Here the Release Notes</a>.
