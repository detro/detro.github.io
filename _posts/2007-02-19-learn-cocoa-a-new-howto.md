<a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/02/18/learn-cocoa-part-ii/">TUAW</a> today highlights this new Tutorial about Cocoa: <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_cocoa/">Learn Cocoa</a> (<a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_cocoa_two/">part II</a>).

Some people on TUAW say that:
<blockquote>... there wasn't actually any coding involved... </blockquote>
But it was about the <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_cocoa/">first part</a>, that is "introductive". In <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_cocoa_two/">this second part</a> seems that things are changing. I haven't readed yet to give a valutation; but I'll do... I promise.

Stay tuned.
