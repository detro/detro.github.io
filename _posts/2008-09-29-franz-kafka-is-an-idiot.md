I just read "The Metamorphosis". And I liked it... until I reached the last page of it.
Where I understood that <strong>Franz Kafka is an Idiot</strong>.

<em>First Edition Cover</em>

I like of course very much the quality and Franz is, out of any doubt, a great novelist... but <strong>I totally disagree with the message, the perspective and the conclusion</strong> of it.

P.S. I read it with the great <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/iphone">Stanza for iPhone</a>.
