This application was bord with the run Classic Application in any operating system. It seems to be an "<em>Emulation-Layer</em>" (so, not a "<em>Virtuallization-Layer</em>") and... it's for available (and supported) on various systems:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> (i386, ppc, x86_64)</li>

	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macosx">MacOS X</a> (<strong>i386</strong>, ppc)</li>

	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29">Darwin</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbsd">NetBSD 2.0</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebsd">FreeBSD 5.3</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows for x86</a></li>
</ul>

As you probably know, Apple, with new MacIntel, has cutted-off the support for Classic: it was a virtuallization, not an emulation and then... a simple recompilation it's not enough.

As you can read before, the project now support MacOSX (i386) machine: reading on the <a href="http://www.gibix.net/dokuwiki/en:projects:sheepshaver">official site of SheepShaver</a> it's clear that the support is experimental. But it's really ;) .

It will can be the simplest solution for users that use MacOS application right now.
