<blockquote><a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fXgl">XGL</a> is an X server architecture layered on top of <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL" title="OpenGL on Wikipedia" target="_new">OpenGL</a>. It is at an early stage in development and a number of important pieces are still missing. Xglx is the only server yet that use this architecture, it requires an already existing X server and is only intended for testing and development.</blockquote>

Because of a slow "development process", <a href="http://www.novell.com/" target="_new" title="Novell web site">Novell</a> decides to migrate the CVS of the Project and to make it private, paying developers to "speed up" the process.

The results are in these <a href="http://www.linuxedge.org/index.php?q=node/39">screenshots</a>.

The next generation of Graphic Server on Linux? I hope it's true!
