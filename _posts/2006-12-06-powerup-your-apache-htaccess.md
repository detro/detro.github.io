<a href="http://www.askapache.com/2006/htaccess/htaccesselite-ultimate-htaccess-article.html">Here</a> is a collection of "code snippets" about the <code>.htaccess</code> file of Apache.
Take a look: it's full of usefull things.

It remembers to me about a very little howto (in italian) that help to make <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/outputs/howtos/siti-web-multipli-senza-vhosts/">multiple web-sites on the same machine... without virtual-hosts</a>: a very little and poor self-production.
