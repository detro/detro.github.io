I have been thinking about a million posts to write, snippets of code to publish, CompSci problems to discuss.

But I'm just really busy at [work](http://www.betfair.com), and not finding the energy to publish anything worth more than a tweet.

A pint for whoever gets why I putted this here
</div>

Yes, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/detronizator). I do believe now that is what stops me from writing a post: **sometimes thoughts are not worth more than a 140 characters**. And the very nature of Twitter also pushes me to be as synthetic as possible. With the result that I don't really post anything anymore. :-(

Is all this twittering killing my Blogging? One thing I know, it managed to practically kill my Feeds subscription: I don't subscribe to blogs anymore. I just follow on twitter who I really think is an interesting person, and they just _throw_ good stuff at me. My [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) is ALWAYS overloaded!

But I do have some stuff stuck in my head that I want to do. Stuff like:

* A new REALLY NICE theme for [Bloggart](github.com/detro/bloggart), that I'm going to use here - of course, based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* I want to solve (and publish the solution) for the [Facebook Puzzles](http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php)
* I want to give a go at [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS), hopefully before gets uncool
* Since [Full Frontal 2010](http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2010/11/15/Full-Frontal-2010---My-transcript), and particularly thanks to [Seb Lee-Delise](http://twitter.com/seb_ly) presentation, I want to get into this HTML5 Canvas crazy-ness, maybe trying out [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)
* Also, I want to port [SlickSpeed CSS Selectors Speed Test](https://github.com/kamicane/slickspeed/) to Google App Engine
* And last, but not least, I want to write a small Google App Engine template to help people turn App Engine into their personal, free CDN 

**Will I ever find the time to do all that?**

Oh yes, I forgot to tell you: I just got [Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood](http://assassinscreed.uk.ubi.com/brotherhood/). And that DEFINITELY doesn't help ;-)
