I really don't know that <a href="http://www.datamanager.it/articoli.php?idricercato=13412">before</a> (article in italian), but it's REALLY ABSURD!!!
I (ipotetically, <strong>I HATE MS</strong>(not the cigarettes ;))) had spent much money for some games and now, if I want to buy a new Xbox 360, MS does not make the console "immediatly retrocompatible" but... I need to spend other money for a "plug-in" (I don't know what exactly but... it's irrelevant).

Why people buy these products?
Why does not buy the Sony Console that is retrocompatible "by project"!?!?!?!
