I shall say that <strong>South Bank river side</strong> is a very nice place: the buildings are practically on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames">River Thames</a>, and it looks like a very romantic place. There are different nice coffee shops (and some are NOT Starbucks ;) ) around there. Quite surprising that this is my 3rd month in this area and I didn't yet taken a proper look at it. I will... (I'm just waiting for a <strong>proper Spring</strong>).
