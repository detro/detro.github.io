Disney was in trouble but... this acquisition is the begin of a <em>rebirth</em> of Disney as a "quality symbol" in the Industry of Digital Animation.

Jobs, because the acquisition was done with a quotation-paiment (entirelly!!!), becames an "heavy member" of the Disney.

I hope to see some beautiful films birth arise from this blending... and a great Apple Software utilization :D (anyone say Final Cut Pro?).
