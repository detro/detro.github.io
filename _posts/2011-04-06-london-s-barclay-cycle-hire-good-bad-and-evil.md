Last Sunday my girlfriend, my friend [@lucabox](http://twitter.com/lucabox) and I decided have a go at [London's Barclays Cycle Hire](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/14808.aspx). Wanting to enjoy the weather in Hyde Park, we agreed at meeting there: Luca cycled from Tate Modern, we took our bike at [Hyde Park's Queen's Gate](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Queen's+Gate,+Westminster,+London+SW7+2,+UK&aq=&sll=51.501854,-0.175036&sspn=0.002454,0.004442&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Queen's+Gate,+Westminster,+London+SW7+2,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=16).

The day was great, and the good weather helped. The experience with those bikes was... follow me.

## The Good

### Cheap to start
The price scheme is simple if you are not a member: we paid just £1.00 to access. The **first 30 minutes are free**, than **£1 for the first hour**, £4 for 1.5 hours and so growing. Details [here](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/14811.aspx).

Maybe not cheap if you are a regular user, but cheap enough for occasional usage.

### Comfy
The bike is really comfy. The **sit is very wide** and the position is straight, so that you don't get tired too quickly.

VERY adjustable sit
</div>

The **sit is easy to adjust**, and it has a lot of possible settings to suit every heights.

### Not for racing
Of course, forget about going too fast: there are **just 3 gears**. The first 2 are quite "light", while the third is only for sustained speeds.

It's designed for an easy, pleasant ride - and that is a good thing if you ask me. Generally londoners are always _on a rush_ - sometimes for no reason.

### Smart-ass proof
One of the members of the group (I won't tell who :-P) tried a trick: given that the price up to 1 hour is £1, instead of let the clock tick up to the second hour, he decided to try a trick: put back the bike and get a new one. In this way the second hour would still cost £1.

</div>

Fortunately (I say) the scheme is smart-ass proof: **when you put back a bike, you can't access any other for at least 5 minutes**. _Gotcha!_

## The Bad

### Heavy
The **bike is pretty heavy**. Again, the bike is not for racing, but it might result a bit _difficult to handle_ for some people, given also that the breaks aren't that great. I'm pretty strong, and still I had to push hard on the break stick to get the thing to stop.

### Docking station lock is too hard
My girlfriend had some issues with the docking station lock: was a bit too hard to release or lock in. But I guess this is a trade off to make it solid and safe.

### Too many "defective" bikes
A lot of bikes, too many if you ask me, were in a _defective state_: they were in perfect conditions, but somehow the **docking station thought they were defective** and wouldn't release those.

Pretty annoying sometimes.

### Not very spread yet
Unfortunately the Barclays Cycle Hire is not very evenly spread across London **(yet?)**. If you take a look to the [official map](https://web.barclayscyclehire.tfl.gov.uk/maps), and zoom out a bit, you will see that only Zone 1 is covered. _Come on Boris: let's put some more on the roads!_

## The Evil

### Unusable buttons at the docking station
I didn't actually explain how you get a bike! Once at the station, you pay with your card and receive a receipt. On the receipt there is a code, a temporary code (that lasts 10 minutes only) of 5/6 digits, composed only of `1`s, `2`s or `3`s.

On the left side of every docked bike is this:
<div class="img">
<img src="http://www.roadcyclinguk.com/uploads/images/Large/9994.jpg" alt="authorisation code input buttons" />
authorisation code input buttons: pure evil!
</div>
this _keypad_ is a made of 3 rubber digital buttons. They are difficult to push (very small) and give you **NO FEEDBACK WHATSOEVER**. Only once you have entered the code, the light turns <span style="color: red;">RED</span> or <span style="color: green;">GREEN</span> (the former if <span style="color: red;">_the code is wrong_</span> or <span style="color: red;">_the bike is defective_</span>, the latter if <span style="color: green;">_the bike has been released_</span>).

The absence of any audio and/or physical feedback at every button push, and the fact that the buttons are almost flat it's just **terrible**. Did anyone actually do any [Usability Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing) on those things before putting it on the road?

Looks like it has been left as a _low priority task_ to the engineers that were on the project. And you can clearly see the terrible results. **Double thumbs down Boris!**

### No freaking Oyster Card? SERIOUSLY???
OK, here I'm really REALLY disappointed: Oyster Cards have been _pushed_ on Londoners for years before becoming widely accepted. [Barclay itself made a special deal with TfL for an all-in-one card](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/termsandconditions/6014.aspx). And now what they do? They force you to pay for those bikes:

* either using your credit card
* or subscribing for a membership that will give you an electronic key

What about Oysters? I understand that this service requires a full identification of the user, but the service could be easily restricted to [registered Oysters only](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/link/0004.do). What is the reason for making people subscribe to a whole new thing? **Nonsense if you ask me!**

## Conclusions
Well, regardless of the (major?) flaws of this scheme, I believe this is a good thing for London and londoners. It's just the beginning, and different aspects need to be tuned, but this can become a good service with time.

**Did you have a chance to give it a spin? What was your experience?**
