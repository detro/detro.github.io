It's TRUE: Audi will run on the 24 Le Mans with a Diesel motor; a TDI engine.

Comment (in Italian) of <a href="http://www.autoblog.it/post/2236/il-v12-turbodiesel-da-corsa-della-audi-r10">www.autoblog.it</a>.

I love cars, and I hate cars (they are destroying the planet), and read about the utilization of a diesel-based engine to run for the 24LM it the sign of a new time for the diesel. Good luke Audi.

ps When run with hybrid or, better, gas-natural engie?
