I would have just posted it on Twitter, but I have some comments about this video.

<div align="center">

<em>One of the first video of the iPad Simulator</em>

<ol>
<li>Watch it in Full screen at 720p: it help "feeling" the proportions used by Apple in the UI</li>
<li>It clarify how it does execute iPhone apps: they most probably implement the iPhone API as is: indeed even the Keyboard that you get in an iPhone application is the same (no super large/super cool keyboard of the iPad</li>
<li>I feel that 4 icons per row are too few: there a <em>kilometers</em> between an icon and the next one</li>
<li>I feel that the hardware home button doesn't fit very well proportionally: they should have used a rectangular button way larger: given the size of the device, is too small</li>
<li>The amount of free space in the top bar (the one with Battery, Time and Signal Strength) is <strong>A JOKE</strong>. In there nice little icons of the services running in background, or tickers of latest emails... or something else <strong>SHOULD fit</strong></li>
<li>Integrated Spotlight is a <em>proportional abomination</em>: why the search bar in the TOP has the fixed size of the one used by iPhone? I mean, it takes not even half of all the width it could</li>
<li>Notification Modal Dialogs (used to ask stuff like <em>"Are you sure you want to delete this app?"</em>) is SO SMALL, that in the middle of the screen looks like you should do something else around it. <strong>EVEN with the background faded in black</strong>: I believe such effect of "prioritization" works as long as the user can't have something else to look at.</li>
<li><strong>File Sharing!!!</strong> It misses a proper Finder Mobile to share files through Bluetooth, USB, Wifi, as well as management of those files! I don't want to email me stuff! And I don't want to pay for an extra software that is not well integrated or it has always some limitations.</li>
</ol>

That's my first set. But surely I'll have more. I need to collect reasons to stick with my position: <strong>iPass</strong>. ;)
