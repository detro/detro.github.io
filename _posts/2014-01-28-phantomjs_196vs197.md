_tl;dr;_ Latest **stable** release of PhantomJS is **1.9.7**, and you
should probably go and [download it](http://phantomjs.org/download.html).
It contains [GhostDriver 1.1.0 "Banquo"](https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.1.0),
and that's it.

1.9.6, released not more than 2 weeks ago (1 week?), was a _coordination went wrong_
and I take part of the responsibility for it. Just discard that release.

# What's the long story?
So, for a few days I was helping with testing and refining the
[new `cookiejar` module (#11535)](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/pull/11535)
for PhantomJS that [Joseph Rollinson (jtrollinson)](https://github.com/jtrollinson)
contributed.
I'm very interested in this module because it allows to instantiate **multiple
Cookie Jar objects** instead of having all the WebPage object use the same jar.
Such feature would allow GhostDriver to finally support
[Session Isolation (#170)](https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/issues/170), a long
overdue feature.

[I had just released GhostDriver 1.1.0](https://ivandemarino.me/2014/01/ghostdriver-1-1-0-codename-banquo/),
and so I was pretty much all setup to do an extra release.
Having that feature supported would make PhantomJS/GhostDriver play better with
Selenium Grid, allowing to register more than 1 session against one browser
process instance.

So, once the `cookijar` thing was merged, I cut
[GhostDriver 1.1.1 "Okiku"](https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.1.1)
and promptly made
[a PR against PhantomJS to merge that in](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/pull/11893).

[Ariya](github.com/ariya) was so kind to wait for me to do that and cut a **minor** release of
PhantomJS: in his intention _just bugfixes and latest GhostDriver_.
Little he knew that latest GhostDriver depended on the new `cookiejar` feature.

So, when he prepared the release branch (by `git cherry-pick`-ing), left out
the `cookiejar` module, but included GhostDriver 1.1.1.

Result? KA-BOOM!

# Lesson Learned
Next time I decide to add support to a major feature (even if it's not in my
direct project but the one I'm based upon), I should increase the
**minor version number** or even the **major** (depending on the case).

If I had done that, Ariya would have known that
_it wasn't just a minor fix in GhostDriver_,
and this mess would have been avoided.

Happy _Ghosting_!
