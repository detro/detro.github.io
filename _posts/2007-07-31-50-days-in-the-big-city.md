When I began this <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2007/02/14/im-in/">new </a><a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2007/02/22/symbian-contracts-packagebox/">experience</a>, during the BootCamp, a Teacher/Employee of <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a>, L.Simpson (yep, "Simpson" :-D ) said:

<blockquote>Wellcome to the Big City!!!</blockquote>

He was referring to the amount of code [en:Symbian OS] is made of. But I think it can be applied to everything here. The feeling of being part of something big.

It is <strong>Frightful</strong>... but Fascinating and Stimulanting too.

Actually, I'm (and I'll be for a lot) "no one" here... but I see a lot of <strong>young guys like me</strong> doing important things. And this is the most stimulating thing: <em>I Could!</em>

P.S.: <strong>50</strong> is the effective number of working days, so I excluded weekends and the BootCamp. I joined Symbian on the 16th of April! ;)
