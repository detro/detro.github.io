... is being woke up at 8:32 on Sunday Morning, after you went to sleep around 02:30.
<div align="center"><img src="http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa252/travellingted/pictute_penguin_bear_dumb.jpg" alt="Wake Up!!!" />
<em>Wake Up! Now!</em>
</div>
And not just woke up "politely": your flatmate comes back at home and turn on his <strong>super-laudly-hard-techno-rock-massive-disruptive music</strong>.

I leave at you to imagine the rest.

Ah, by the way: just attached to his room, in the flat next to us, there a very Old-Style-Super-Polite English Couple. -_-
