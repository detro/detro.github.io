Title: <strong>3D morphable model face animation</strong>
<strong>by Volker Blantz</strong>
</blockquote>

This demo, if real, shows a new and fantastic system to make 3d model of our faces. With only one photo, the system can extract our face-structure, in a simple and powerfull way.
Obviously, applications are infinites.
