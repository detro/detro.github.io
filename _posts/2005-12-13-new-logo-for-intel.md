Intel wants to rebrand itself: <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/2005/12/08/intel_rebranding/">here</a> a link to the article.
On the web, there is various new example "brands" for Intel:
<img src="http://www.melablog.it/uploads/newlogointel.jpg" alt="new ipotetical logo for Intel" /> .

Here an interesting comment of <a href="http://www.melablog.it/post/1209/e-questo-il-nuovo-logo-di-intel#more">MelaBlog</a> about this question.

Anyway, I think thats are only speculations: that logos are no "credible" for a company like Intel. <strong>IMHO</strong>.
