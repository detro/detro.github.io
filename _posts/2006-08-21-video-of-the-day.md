<a href="http://www.kloss-online.co.uk/">KLOSS</a> does not sell many things, but stomachs need to be filled, and the price of erasers keeps rising. After over two years in development, '<a href="http://www.kloss-online.co.uk/21058.html">DeLighTable</a>' is finally avaliable to buy as a commercial product. The real work obviously lies in the pressure sensitive surface, but now it also comes in an attractive casing. With a framework finished in polished stainless steel, DeLighTable has taken the guise of a slim coffe table only twenty five millimetres thick. To purchase, simply fill in a form through the 'contact us' section. The tables are made to order, and the typical lead time is four to six weeks.
