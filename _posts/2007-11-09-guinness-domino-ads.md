After a lot of unmotivated comments (for the quality of the Movie itself) about <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2006/08/20/domino-harvey-storia-vera/">my post about Domino Harvey</a>, I finally have another Domino to talk about.

This is an ads going on in the UK TV. It's from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness">Guinness</a>, one of the most strong-tasty (I say "not very much good tasty"), beer that you can find in any pub here.
But the advert is very very good ;)
