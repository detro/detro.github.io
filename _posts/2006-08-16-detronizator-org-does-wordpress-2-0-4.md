Because of the diffused inactivity on the servers of my hoster (Top Host) I catch'up the time to upgrade (finally) ot Wordpress 2.0.4.

Here the official release message:
<blockquote>
WordPress 2.0.4, the latest stable release in our Duke series, is <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">available for immediate download</a>. This release contains several important security fixes, so it’s highly recommended for all users. We’ve also rolled in a number of bug fixes (over 50!), so it’s a pretty solid release across the board.

Upgrading is fairly simple, just overwrite your old files with the latest from the download. If you’d like more thorough instructions, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">the Codex</a> is always the best spot.

Since this is a security release, if you have any friends with blogs make sure to remind them to upgrade and lend a hand if they’re not too savvy. We’re all in this together.

Thanks to <a href="http://veryeasy.ca/">Geoff</a> and <a href="http://txfx.net/">Mark Jaquith</a> for identifying.
