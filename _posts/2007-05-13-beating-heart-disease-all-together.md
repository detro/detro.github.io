It's the name of a <a href="http://www.bhf.org.uk/news_and_campaigning/our_campaigns/30_a_day_campaign.aspx">very funny (and smart) campain of the "British Heart Foundation"</a>, that wants to help any "over 50" (but why not also "under 50" ;-) ) to take "30 Minuts everyday" to do... something good for their hearts.

The [en:British_Heart_Foundation|B.H.F.] has make a lot of funny ads (there are a lot of them everywhere here in London). My favourite? The answer could not be more obvious.
