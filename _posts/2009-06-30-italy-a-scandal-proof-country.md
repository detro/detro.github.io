I feel ashamed. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a> a week ago released <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/23/silvio-berlusconi-escort-girls-scandal">this article</a> explaining, in a "reasonably informed way" why "nothing happens after all the scandals in which the <em>Psycho-Nano</em> is involved".

I say "reasonably informed way" because, normally, newspapers that are not Italian don't really get what the man is: to understand Berlusconi you need to understand what Italy became today.

In any case, in this situations, I feel ashamed of being Italian. And doesn't matter "that I'm not him": I'm Italian, Italy is my Country, but it's like seeing a beautiful woman destroying herself with alcohol, unable to understand when she should stop.
