Finally, someone makes it: it's probabile the best fitting things for me and my iCal addiction.<br /><img src="http://spanningsync.com/icon-reflection.jpg" align="right" /><br />I have ever thinked about the possibilty of sync my iCall calendars (8 or 9... 8O ) with <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">GCal</a>, thinking that the Google WebApp is very very impressive and beautiful... but there was nothing that make it easy and effective.<br /><br />Now, the light at the end of the tunnel.<br />It's not available right now... but soon it will be. Until then, take a look to the <a href="http://blog.spanningsync.com/">Blog</a>.<br /><br />Into the GGroup "<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-mac">Macs inside Google</a>" there is a very interesting topic <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-mac-news/browse_thread/thread/b09fd79cccdedc95">about the looking for beta testers</a>.
