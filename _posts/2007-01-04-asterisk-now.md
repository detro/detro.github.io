A new distro-based version of <a href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a>, with the aim of make a smart-setup of an Astrisk PBX Server easy and quick.

<blockquote>Asterisk® in 30 minutes or less. The most popular open source PBX software, Asterisk®, can now be easily configured with a graphical interface. AsteriskNOW™ is an open source Software Appliance; a customized Linux distribution that includes Asterisk®, the Asterisk GUI, and all other software needed for an Asterisk® system.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.asterisknow.org/">Here</a> the homepage of the Project. It have, in my opinion, 2 big features:
<ol>
	<li>It is completelly web manageable (in the intent of the developers)</li>
	<li>It's based on Asterisk 1.4.0 (a very powerfull version)</li>
</ol>

Obviously, this project is in keen competition with <a href="http://www.trixbox.org/index.php">TrixBox</a>, the oldest distro-based version of Asterisk.
