Yet [another](/2015/07/HTB-means-richer-builders/) take on expensive housing.

I'm not sure I fully agree with the idea that poor aesthetic (actually, _ugliness_)
has a dominating role in the pricing bubble. I still believe the the biggest issue
is with political choices, that most probably are driven by lobbist interests.

Nevertheless this video is an interesting and watch-worth perspective.
