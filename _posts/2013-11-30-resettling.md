**Puff, Pant!** THAT was not easy! But finally, "normality" seems not too far
away.

Many things have happened in the recent months: we got **married**; I helped my
lovely wife with the **pregnancy** (well, she did all the hard work); and, on the
7th of November, we have became parents of this **beauty**:

</div>

Now, we have to slowly learn to live our new life **together**: while we learn
how to be parents, Leonardo will be learning how to be a baby. What now looks
like a difficult, consuming and intense task (ask me how much we sleep
at night!), will at some point become "daily routine".
_A sweeter routine with Leo at the center of it all!_

It is a full **RESET** to which we need to **SETTLE**. A **RESETTLE**.

A new life,
with many unknowns to uncover, but also the will and need to be as united and as
strong - actually, even more. But love seems to be our great strength, and
Alessandra and I are quite good at _teamwork_.

# Night sleep: a memory of the past

Well, as EVERYONE warned us, sleeping with a newborn baby is like trying to play
retro videogames: you ALWAYS want to do, but never manage to.

Leonardo is a very unstable sleeper so far, and he seems to like to be more
active during the night: maybe a good skill if he decides to join me in the
_craft of programming_, but for now it's just an energy drain (for us!).
A drain that transforms into a sweet smile once you see his eyes looking at you.
You are tired, you are exhausted but, somehow, his puffy cheeks make
everything perfect.

One thing that seems to work is carrying him around, while I rock him and tell
him all sort of _stuff_, just from the top of my head.
I think I have already talked him into becoming a software developer: he hasn't
disagreed, so I assume he is OK with it :-P .

# Time for ourselves?

This is close to `0` for now. Either as a couple, or on our own, time to do
stuff by yourself seems a very hard thing to achieve. But I'm sure it will get
better: myself I'm still a night-worker, so with his sleeping becoming more
regular, working a bit on **opensource** or playing videogames will be
eventually possible.

## Blog migration finished!

Talking of having no time to do stuff, while it seemed quite impossible,
I have indeed managed to complete
the blog migration! It took a while to do
the different bits, and I still have stuff to work on, but I'm now serving this
from [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the static HTML/CSS/JS.
Much happier: I can move to any other hosting in a matter of hours. I don't
even know why I was bothering to use non-static content for
blogging/personal site.

If interested, the repository with all the source code (posts +
Jekyll plugins) can be found at my
[detro/detro.github.io "source" branch](https://github.com/detro/detro.github.io/tree/source).

# Resume blogging

Migrating the blog means also producing more content, right?
Well, this is a first attempt. Not a great one, I admit -
I find quite difficult to come up with things to say, when my brain it's
affected by sleep deprivation.
But I have a TODO list on my whiteboard of things I want to talk about:

1. Bought and still setting up a [N54L](http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html?oid=5336624#!tab=features)
[ZFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) NAS at home: I think some of the
decisions I have taken so far in the configuration process are worth sharing
2. An update on the status of the
[GhostDriver](https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver) and
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) projects
3. A satiric bible-related story that I want to publish (very short and
quite offensive :P)
4. [Sulfur](https://github.com/detro/sulfur), that I haven't introduced
nor documented properly _yet_: it's a tiny Java library that provides a level
of abstraction over [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)
5. 2013 is the year I read the most in my life:
[George R.R. Martin](http://www.georgerrmartin.com/) and
[Arthur Conan Doyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle)
_in primis_
6. I'm leaving [Amazon AIV ADCL](http://www.amazondcl.com/)
7. Algorithms that I have re-studied and coded examples of

# Catching up on personal projects

I have been quite far from [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/),
[GhostDriver](https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver) and
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org). Partially is my fault (I did spend some time
playing _GTA V_ before Leonardo was here), but mostly is because of all the
above.

While I don't really have a fully up-to-date picture of what's happening with
PhantomJS, I know that
[Vitallium is working on the porting to Qt5](https://github.com/Vitallium/phantomjs-qt5).
That is a very exciting perspective, and the project looks like it has a
brilliant future ahead.

Also, the [Qt-Project](http://qt-project.org/) is
[moving Chromium/Blink](http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2013/06/25/experimenting-with-chromium-and-qt/):
this means that PhantomJS architecture will have to change sensibly, the core
will be based on a more _commercial_ browser and, most importantly, I believe
a full API compatibility break would be a given. _Why is that good?_ Because
we could apply all we learned from developing PhantomJS so far, and do a better
job in many areas.

## Quick note about GhostDriver

GhostDriver has received some love (aka _Pull Requests_). I have worked to
integrate them into an upcoming `1.1.0`, but I think there are other more
pressing improvements to do, before considering a release.

And, if you really want to, you can still check out the `master` branch
and run it inside latest PhantomJS. So, I don't feel too much pressure to
package a full release.

_That's all for now._

**P.S.** I still haven't told you what's my next job, have I? :)
