It's, IMHO, <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/installer/">the project</a> that can give to Gentoo the right "power" and "motivation" to become the BEST source-based distribution in the world (is it not already? ;)).

The installer looks really coerent with the "manual-old-style" Gentoo Installation and offers an on-line help to guide the user through the (beautiful) installation process.

There is a graphical partitioning tool and ... some other interesting features.

Good luck Gentoo.
