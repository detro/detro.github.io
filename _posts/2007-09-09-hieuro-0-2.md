Here we are. 0.2.
0.2 of nothing but a "<em>divertissment</em>" which help me to learn better and better the Cocoa Framework, and discover all the magic stuff it does.

The release notes is:
<blockquote><dl>
<dt>0.2 (2007-09-09)</dt>
<dd>
	<li>Support for Italian, Spanish, French and German (Thanks to <a href="http://secretum.neminis.org/">Manu</a>).</li>

	<li>New "Preferences" panel to set the "Default Currency" to convert from/to and the "Default Currency Ammount" to set at the application startup (Thanks to the <a href="http://alhandra.wordpress.com/">Alhandra's</a> suggestion).</li>
<li>Remove a Bug in the "German Mark" definition (I wrote "Deutsche Mark" in the English version :P )</li>
</dd></dl></blockquote>

One important aspect I learnt is how to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/cocoabindings.html">bind Preferences to the User Defaults</a> (the Cocoa default preferences system). Pratically, the one that generates, for every app, a file <code>.plist</code> in your <code>~/Library/Preferences</code> directory. Unix-Style joined with Apple-Style.

Who is interested, I updated the <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/outputs/experiments-with-cocoa/hieuro/">HiEuro page</a> with <a href="http://downloads.detronizator.org/HiEuro-0.2.dmg">Binary</a> and <a href="http://downloads.detronizator.org/HiEuro-0.2-src.zip">Source</a> of the version 0.2. so, don't be shy! ;)
