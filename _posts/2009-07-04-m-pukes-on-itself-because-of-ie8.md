I mean, you could puke because of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx">IE8</a> for sure, but to make an ad to support the idea... :-P

<div align="center">
<object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3HiIHV14A-c&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/3HiIHV14A-c&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object>>
</div>

I'm not really sure that this ad is from M$ but, what the hell, it's disgustingly funny! :D
