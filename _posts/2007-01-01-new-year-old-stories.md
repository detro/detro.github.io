No, It's not a post on politics or demagogy: it's about foolishness!!!
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_DVD">HD-DVD</a>, one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc">2 "standards"</a> of the future of Home-Movie (and Digital Video Storage in general), seems to be cracked... already.

An anonymous cracker, called <strong>muslix64</strong>, have published a post on <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=119871">Doom9</a> about a very little Java program that is capable of Rip <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS">AACS</a>-Encrypted video from an HD-DVD.

More info on a page of Wikipedia dedicated to this program, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BackupHDDVD">BackupHDDVD</a>.
Source, <a href="http://it.theinquirer.net/2006/12/decrittato_il_sistema_aacs.html">The Inquier IT</a>.

What about foolishness? Do you remember the HDDVD vs. Blue-Ray Disc war? :D :D :D
