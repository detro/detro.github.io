<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/complang.python/browse_frm/thread/32dc95bd671542f3/">Google assumes the creator of Python.</a>
As you (probably) know, Python is one of the most used language in G. (together with C++ and Java).

A good thing (evolution and power for Python development) or the transformation of Python in a "Google only oriented language"?

Stay tuned.
