<blockquote> A good programming language is far more than a simple collection of features. My ideal is to provide a set of facilities that smoothly work together to support design and programming styles of a generality beyond my imagination. Here, I briefly outline rules of thumb (guidelines, principles) that are being applied in the design of [en:C++0x]. Then, I present the state of the standards process (we are aiming for C++09) and give examples of a few of the proposals such as concepts, generalized initialization, being considered in the ISO [en:C++] standards committee. Since there are far more proposals than could be presented in an hour, I'll take questions.

Dr. [en:Bjarne Stroustrup] is the original designer and implementer of the C++ Programming Language. </blockquote>

It's a <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/media/C%2B%2B0x%20-%20An%20Overview.html">video</a> (available also for download in a plenty of different formats) recorded in the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo (Canada)</a> at the <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/">Computer Science Club</a>.

A very interesting lecture from the father of C++. I don't think you need other details, do you?

Btw, I have already wrote about the new C++0x: <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2006/01/09/c0x-il-nuovo-standard-c/">the post</a> is in Italian, sorry.
