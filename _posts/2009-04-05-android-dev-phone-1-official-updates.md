<img src="http://www.livbit.com/article/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/google_android_dev_phone_1.jpg" width="200" align="right" />For the once of you that tried <em>"home made ways"</em> to update their ADP1, like <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2009/03/08/andoird-dev-phone-1-to-git-master-and-back/">my previously published how-to</a>, this news can be interesting.

<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/03/developer-news.html">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.htc.com">HTC</a> finally managed to push-out an <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/support/android/adp.html">official page on the HTC site</a>, to explain step-by-step how to <strong>update firmware and baseband of the device</strong>.

I just did it, having a very pleasant and straightforward experience.
The phone seems to be <strong>way more stable</strong>, bug-free and the battery lasts for more then 50 seconds ;)

Enjoy!
