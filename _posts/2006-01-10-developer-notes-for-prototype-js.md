Today, with my friend and co-worked Sbatman, we were trying to understand how the famous <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/" target="_new">prototype.js</a> library works.

For not-Ajax developer: <blockquote>Prototype is a JavaScript framework that aims to ease development of dynamic web applications. Featuring a unique, easy-to-use toolkit for class-driven development and the nicest Ajax library around, Prototype is quickly becoming the codebase of choice for Web 2.0 developers everywhere.</blockquote>

After an afternoon without appreciable results ( :cry: ), Sbatman found that documentation online: <a target="_new" href="http://www.sergiopereira.com/articles/prototype.js.html">Developer Notes for prototype.js</a>.
<blockquote>What is it?
In case you haven't already used it, <a target="_new" href="http://prototype.conio.net/">prototype.js</a> is a JavaScript library written by <a href="http://www.conio.net/" target="_new">Sam Stephenson</a>. This amazingly well thought and well written piece of standards-compliant code takes a lot of the burden associated with creating rich, highly interactive web pages that characterize the Web 2.0 off your back.

If you tried to use this library recently, you probably noticed that documentation is not one of its strongest points. As many other developers before me, I got my head around prototype.js by reading the source code and experimenting with it. I thought it would be nice to take notes while I learned and share with everybody else. </blockquote>
