I have migrated my site to WordPress 2.0 today. But, as you can se, some changes are "under the hood".

In particular, significative changes are for the Admin: read <a target="_blank" href="http://asymptomatic.net/2005/11/29/2135/whats-new-in-wordpress-20">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:PotterSys/Media_Managment">here</a>.

Want's to migrate to WP2.0? Read this <a target="_blank" title="upgrading wordpress" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">BEAUTIFUL guide</a> (from <span style="font-weight: bold">codex</span>, obviously), and download this AMAZING piece of code <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/download/">here</a>.

If you loved the Administrative interface of WP for it's simplicity, this new interface, heavly based on <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax">, will make you screaming. I'm sure ;).</a>
