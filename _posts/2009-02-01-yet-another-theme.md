Yes, still experimenting with Themes. This one is "<a href="http://templates.arcsin.se/emplode-website-template/">Emplode</a>", by <a href="http://arcsin.se/">arcsin.se</a>.

A little bit more classic than the previous one. I like it's clean and slick style, but with classic and "paper-ish" colors.

Let's see if it last or I change my mind again.
