[en:Andrew Tanenbaum] recently released the 3rd edition of <a href="http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/Student/detail.asp?item=100000000277564">Modern Operating Systems</a>, and there is a brand new chapter about [en:Symbian OS].

I think that this is a reflection of the importance that <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a> OS has at present. This also means that more people will probably learn about Symbian OS as part of their university courses.
Thanks for the interest <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/">Andy</a>.

I'll buy it (or borrow from our library) very soon ;-) .
