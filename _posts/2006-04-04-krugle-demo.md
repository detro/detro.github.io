I subscribe the beta-testing program of this new, powerfull search engine for developers.
Yesterday an email advertise me that a very interesting screencast is available, to explain the target and the features of this engine.

Other than the features, the heavy usage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax">Ajax</a> is very beautiful. But "bando alle ciance": see the screencast <a href="http://www.krugle.com/demos/Overview5_1024.html">here</a>.
