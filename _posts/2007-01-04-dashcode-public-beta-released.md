If you have an <a href="http://developer.apple.com">ADC (Apple Developer Connection)</a> account and you are interested in Widget's Development, probably you'll consider interesting to know that <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/dashcode/index.html">Apple have released the beta of Dashcode</a>.

Personally, I'm not a Dashboard lover. I have disabled it few days after Tiger Installation: it <em>wolf down</em> much too much memory... and, if I need a "small-service-app", I use an equivalent web-page or normal-app.
