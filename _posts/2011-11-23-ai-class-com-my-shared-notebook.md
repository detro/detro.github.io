I decide that is very little point in keep writing posts just to highlight new notes, as I finish to write them. So, I decide to just share with the world [all my notes about the ai-class](https://www.evernote.com/pub/detro/aiclass).

You will find them in (sort of) chronological order, and will give also an idea on how I studied so far (as every material I produced is in there).

About the homework, I'll make sure NOT TO PUBLISH THEM BEFORE the respective deadline: I don't want to break the [Stanford Honor Code](http://ed.stanford.edu/academics/masters-handbook/honor-code).

By the way, have you done the Midterm Exam? How did it go for you? I got 100% (yeah!). Hopefully I'll manage to maintain this trend ;)

**Good luck and happy AI Class!**
