Take a look here: the <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/">Transport of London website</a>. Well organized, rich, usefull. Every information users needs, also with other services like RSS News about "delays", "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube">tube</a> enhancements", "contest and festive related informations and suggestions".

Besides, Transport system itself is powerfull, effective and "right": English people speaks about a "not enought services, so poor transport system". They are accustomed to something richer than me. And than every "Napoletane" people.

This is my first reason: I hope to dismiss my car and to use ONLY tube and other "walk-based" transports.

What about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA">IKEA</a>? How to transport my closet to my home? Have you ever known the meaning of "rent a car"? ;)
