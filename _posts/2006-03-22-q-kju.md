<blockquote>Run Windows, Linux and a lot more Systems on your Mac. Q is a feature packed cocoa port of QEMU: Switch fast between guest PCs. Save and restart guest PCs at any stage. Easily exchange Files between Host and Guest. Q makes use of OS X most advanced technologies like openGL and coreaudio to accelerate your experience with your guest PC.</blockquote>

This is "only" an easy-interface to <a href="http://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>, &laquo;<em>a generic and open source processor emulator which achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation</em>&raquo;, but it works very very good (and smarty, imho).

If you need a good and rich System-Emulator (it support <strong>x86, x86-64, PPC PowerMac, PPC PREP, Sparc32, MIPS</strong> right now!) on your Mac, <a href="http://www.kberg.ch/q/">give its a chance</a>!
