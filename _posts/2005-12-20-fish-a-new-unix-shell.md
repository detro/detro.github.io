<a target="_new" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">Bash</a> is a standard (de facto), as every *nix user now but... this is the beauty of the OpenSource: any other programmer can think "hey, I want to remake this in another way!" and, than, do!

For screenshots-addicted users (like me ;)), go <a target="_new"  href="http://roo.no-ip.org/fish/screenshots.html">here</a>.
