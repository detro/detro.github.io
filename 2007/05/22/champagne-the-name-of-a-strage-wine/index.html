                <h2>Champagne, the Name of a strage Wine</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Almost 5 weeks ago a collegues (and now friend) of mine was wondering about the name of &quot;Champagne&quot;:</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Champagne.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Champagne.jpg" alt="Champagne" width="300" /></a></div>

<blockquote>...
Wines from the Champagne region were already known before medieval times. Churches owned vineyards, and monks produced wine for use in the sacrament of Eucharist. French kings were traditionally anointed in Reims. Champagne wine flowed as part of coronation festivities.
Kings appreciated the still, light, and crisp wine, and offered it as an homage to other monarchs in Europe. In the 17th century, still wines of Champagne were the chosen wines for celebration in European countries. The English were the biggest consumers of Champagne wines, and drank a lot of sparkling wines.
...</blockquote>

<p>So, the name is from the [en:Champagne_(province)|French province] where it was &quot;created&quot;.</p>

<p>The rest on [en:Champagne_(wine)|Wikipedia].</p>
