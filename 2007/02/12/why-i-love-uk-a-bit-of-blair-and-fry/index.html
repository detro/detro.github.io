Few days ago I had changed the subtitle of my [en:weblog]
<blockquote></p>

<p>Consider yourself Perfectible makes you Perfect!</p>

<p></blockquote></p>

<p>It&#39;s not about me... or, better, it&#39;s not ONLY about me. It&#39;s about EVERYTHING. About Countries too. What it means? Follow me...</p>

<p>Today I have listened (and <a href="http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page10934.asp">readed</a>) this podcast entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page10617.asp">PM (Prime Minister) and Stephen Fry reflect on modern Britishness</a>&quot;: it&#39;s the newest podcast from the website of <a href="http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/page1.asp">10, Downing Street</a>. I have discovered it also, after <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2006/12/27/why-i-love-uk-a-not-so-serious-monarchy/">the one about the Queen</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, it&#39;s an interesting discussion between [en:Tony<em>Blair|Tony Blair] and the great [en:Stephen</em>Fry|Stephen Fry] about the Culture, the Morals, the Multi-Culturalism and the last-10-years Growth of the [en:United_Kingdom|UK].</p>

<p>The discussion go through the various arguments not in a extremelly formal way, but with &quot;A Bit of Humor&quot; (in particular thanks to Fry ;) ), demonstrating the capaciousness of the PM too of &quot;[en:Take<em>it</em>Easy|take it easy]&quot;.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it does not fall in banality but, instead, demonstrates the attention of the UK&#39;s Institution regards new technology, youth&#39;s needs and the weight to be a country where &quot;people want to come to live&quot;. Fry and Blair, indisputably proud to be British, don&#39;t forget to remember and underline &quot;what remains to do&quot;; to highlight that &quot;they are not perfect&quot;.</p>

<p>But, I&#39;m not looking for a perfect country: I&#39;m looking for <strong>something like [en:United_Kingdom|this]!. A Country that </strong><strong>TAKE CARE OF ME</strong>!</p>

<p>Source, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/02/09/mainstreaming-podcasts-first-the-queen-now-blair/">TUAW</a>.</p>

<p>p.s. What&#39;s? About the title? British friends probably remember [en:A<em>Bit</em>of<em>Fry</em>and_Laurie|Stephen and Hugh], do they not?
p.p.s. <strong>Thank you to Lelly</strong>: the sentence &quot;<em>Consider yourself Perfectible makes you Perfect</em>&quot; was created during a conversation between us. The original version was in Italian:
<blockquote></p>

<p>Ritenersi Perfettibili Rende Perfetti!</p>
