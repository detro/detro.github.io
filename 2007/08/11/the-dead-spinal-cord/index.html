Title: <strong>Bella Ciao</strong>

<p>A friend of mine, <a href="http://sbetelmal.blogspot.com/">one that I&#39;d have never expected something like that</a>, has sent to me this email:
<blockquote>
I heard this song by mistake and i loved the music
if you have time and if it is not ball breaking i want to ask you to translate it for me
[...]
</blockquote></p>

<p>And then I replied:
<blockquote>
You choosen probably the &quot;spinal cord&quot; of the Italy.
The FORGOTTEN spinal cord.
What has joined us against Fascists + Nazists during the Second World War.</p>

<p>The origin is not sure, but it comes from the Partigians, people in the middle-north of Italy that has fightened (and death) for the Freedom against Mussolini and his stupid idea of joining Nazists.</p>

<p>Today, in every young knows it... but only very old man REALLY UNDERSTAND what it means. Not because of the words (they are few and simple) but because of the &quot;carried message&quot;, the &quot;payload&quot; of this song.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can find a lot of translations here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_ciao">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_ciao</a></p>

<p>Thanks for remembering me the &quot;good part&quot; of my beautiful country.

<p>I don&#39;t think I need to write more.
My heart is already crying for it.
And, yep, it&#39;s not a &quot;Dead Spinal Cord&quot;: WE have <em>SIMPLY FORGOTTEN</em> it!</p>

<p>Bella <em>Italia</em>, Ciao.</p>
