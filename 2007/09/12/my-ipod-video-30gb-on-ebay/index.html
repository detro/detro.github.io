<p><strong>Update 2007-09-14:</strong>
<a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=290160762876&ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT&ih=019">I re-listed it on eBay</a> because they contacted me and said that I&#39;ll receive my money for the 2 auction back. As usual, eBay has a great Customer Care (or, at least, this is my present and past experience about that).
<hr /></p>

<p><strong>Update 2007-09-12:</strong> I sold it twice. Twice was a spoof/fake. :( </p>

<p>A fake account on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk">eBay</a> bought it with the option &quot;Buy Now&quot;. Then he asked to me to send the product in Africa (Nigeria) and asked to me to pay with PayPal. In the beginning I thought it was strange... but with the money, I would sell also in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Then, I received a fake-mail from <a href="http://www.paypal.co.uk/">PayPal</a>, pretending to be the receipt of the payment. I checked, also on the PayPal website to be sure.</p>

<p>So, I spent €28 as fees for the Auctions... for nothing. I asked to eBay to have my money back... but I think there is no hope.</p>

<p>So, <a href="http://www.gumtree.com/cgi-bin/show_posting.pl?posting_id=13500886">I putted it on Gumtree.com</a> for who is in London and could be interested in it.
Come on!!! £170.00 is a very very cheap price for all this stuff! ;)

<p>The Auction is for: <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=290159283890&ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT&ih=019">iPod Video + Incase Sport Armband + Sennheisser CS-300 In Ear Earphones</a>!</p>
