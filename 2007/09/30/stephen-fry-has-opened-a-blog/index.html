<p>From [en:Stephen_Fry|Wikipedia]:
<blockquote>

I like this man. I discovered him thanks to <a href="http://www.detronizator.org/search/laurie">Laurie</a>, and reading and watching him I discovered that he is great on his own.</p>

<em>Fry and his FryPhone (is not my idea: is him)</em>
</div>

<p>And now <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/">he has a blog</a>. Just 2 post, but both interesting a sharper than you can expect from a &quot;Theater/Letterature Man&quot;. Particularly, I suggest the first one about <em>SmartPhones, iPhone and (hypothetical) iPhone-Killers</em>: <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/?p=3">Devices and Desires</a>.</p>

<p>Best Wishes for Your new &quot;experiment&quot;, Mr. Fry. ;)</p>

<p>P.S. If you want to understand how good is this man as actor, watch &quot;[en:A Bit of Fry and Laurie]&quot; (all the 4 seasons): I bought all the DVDs. As soon as I finish my third english-written book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Fear-Greg-Iles/dp/0451180410">Mortal Fear by Greg Iles</a>, I&#39;ll buy (or I&#39;ll borrow from the Symbian Library) [en:The_Liar|The Liar by Fry]: then, I&#39;ll &quot;evaluate&quot; him also as writer.</p>
