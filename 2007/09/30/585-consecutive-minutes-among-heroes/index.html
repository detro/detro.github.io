<p><strong>Update 2007-10-02:</strong>
I just discovered that [en:NBC] has released, during all the Heroes series, graphic novels that &quot;complete&quot; the Heroes story. More details [en:List<em>of</em>Heroes<em>graphic</em>novels|here].</p>

<p>Good stuff NBC!!!

<p>WOW. I&#39;m addicted. Another time.</p>

<p>On June 200<strong>7</strong> my friend Nemo wrote a post about his new addiction, [en:Heroes_(TV series)|Heroes], a brand new american TV Serial:
<blockquote>Heroes is an American science fiction drama television series, created by Tim Kring, which premiered on NBC on September 25, 2006. The show tells the story of several people who &quot;thought they were like everyone else... until they realized they have incredible abilities&quot; such as telepathy, time travel, flight and spontaneous regeneration. These people soon realize they have a role in preventing a catastrophe and saving mankind. The series emulates the writing style of American comic books with short, multi-episode story arcs that build upon a larger, more encompassing arc. Kring said &quot;we have talked about where the show goes up to five seasons.&quot;

</div>

<p>I was curious, but at that time I found no time to <del>download</del> see the series. But, 2 weeks ago, I found <del>a torrent with</del> all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_%28TV_series%29#Season_one">First Season</a>.</p>

<p>Here is my progression (on all the 23 episodes):
<ul>
<li>Sunday 23th of Septeber 2007: 5 episodes - Level of Addiction: High</li>
<li>Wednesday 26th of September 2007: 1 episode - Level of Addiction: High</li>
<li>Friday 28th of September 2007: 4 episodes - Level of Addiction: Very High</li>
<li>Saturday 29th of September 2007 (yesterday): 13 (!!!) episodes - Level of Addiction: <strong>Headache</strong></li>
</ul></p>

<p>Now? Now I have ready in my external hard drive the first episode of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_%28TV_series%29#Season_two">Second Season</a>. But... I have also the first episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alone_%28House%29">House 4x</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_episodes_%28Season_4%29#A_Change_Is_Gonna_Come">Grey&#39;s Anatomy 4x</a>.</p>

<p>Help me, pleeeeez!!! :D</p>

<p>P.S. Every episode is 45 min. long.
P.P.S. [en:Hayden Panettiere], the Cheerleader is an Celestial Creature 8O !
