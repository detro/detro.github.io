Who knows me better, knows that I love the [en:WWW|Web]. So, I was seeking for info about the next generation of web.</p>

<p>What I mean with &quot;next generation&quot;? I mean &quot;what we can expect to see in the future&quot;.
And the best place, is to go were people (with good skills) go and start to discuss and brainstorm about this stuff.</p>

<p>I found a very interesting pre-RFC: <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">HTML 5 Working Draft</a>.
All the amazing and cool stuff are coming are there and is pointless for me to report them (just one: <strong>Client-Side Persistency!!!</strong> COOOOL!). But it&#39;s interesting to see WHO is working on this. I mean, who is ALREADY thinking about what we will have in the &quot;next World Wide Web&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://ian.hixie.ch/">Ian Hickson</a>. He is famous in &quot;our&quot; world but I never spent a minute taking a look to <a href="http://ian.hixie.ch/career/resume.html">his CV</a>. And his &quot;poor&quot; (for a person that does what he does) web site.</p>

<p>Tripping around his web page, he is doing his favourite work... in the best place possible to do this (<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>).</p>

<p>Besides, another interesting thing to notice is the name of the companies working with him (or, better, that seems to own this VERY IMPORTANT document): Apple, Mozilla and Opera. Why Google is missing if the they pay the Employee?</p>
