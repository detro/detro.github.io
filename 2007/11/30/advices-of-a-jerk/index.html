<blockquote><span style="font-size: 130%;"><strong>Title:</strong> Advices of a Jerk</span>

I have as much qualities as deficiencies,
I would miss virtues.
But an Older Brother is not every time right,
just Older.
And I know how to badger you about everything,
it is clear I should stop,
but for your unluckiness 
I have no sons and I have to bring to you Advices of a Jerk.

<em>If they say to stand up, sit down
and when they sit down, stand up.
Do not believe only in what you can see
Pursuit you dreams as long as you believe they are true.</em>

And, suddenly, everyone will be your friend
They will say to love you for what you are
but they will want only to have a piece of what you have.
But
<strong>There will be Mom forever.
She has younger eyes than us.
With here you'll have precious days,
stay with her as much as you can.</strong>
Don't care if models or salesgirls, 
or some girls will make fun of you.
Look after them as Princesses,
you will be a King.

<em>If they say to stand up, sit down
and when they sit down, stand up.
Do not believe only in what you can see
Pursuit you dreams as long as you believe in them.</em>

They will insult you yelling, so You laugh.
They will close your mough, so You write.
If they will hit you and they will impose you prohibitions
You mock them and sing their secrets.

You have my determination to make every mistake
before to learn from them.
But sometimes it's not worthed the price,
as when you were playing in the courtyard
and was my duty to look after you...
or at least try to.
You will do as you wish.
You will follow your idea.
Let's do a turn around the buoy,
also if there is high tide.
It's a vice of our family,
like this Advices of a Jerk.

<em>If they say to stand up, sit down
and when they sit down, stand up.
Do not believe only in what you can see
Pursuit you dreams as long as you make them true.</em>

And then, when the party is over
everyone will go away.
You will finally realize that what is still their is enough
and, yeah, that's your home.

They will insult you yelling, so You laugh.
They will close your mough, so You write.
If they will hit you and they will impose you prohibitions
You mock them and sing their secrets.
</blockquote>

<p>For my Sister and all my Brothers. I love You all and You are in my heart forever.</p>
