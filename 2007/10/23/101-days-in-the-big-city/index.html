<em><strong>Taipei 101</strong>: The tallest building in the world since 2004</em>
</div>

<p>This is my 101 days. Writing a post on the 100 (<a href="http://www.detronizator.org/2007/07/31/50-days-in-the-big-city/">50</a> * 2) was just too obvious ;) </p>

<p>A lot of things are changed, and a lot are still changing. My life is stable like an Elephant on the point of a needle.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Big City</a> has giving a lot to my &quot;maturation process&quot; as Software Engineer, but <em>it&#39;s not just gold because it sparkle</em>, is it? <strong>But it worth it</strong>. We come out of University thinking &quot;we deserve the best&quot;, but we don&#39;t. At least, <strong>we don&#39;t yet</strong>. I&#39;m figuring out, every day much more clearly, that University is just a gym, and whatever we did there, it is just not enough for the business world.</p>

<p>But this is a good thing, at the end of the day. I&#39;m sure it should be nice to feel a genius, but is it &quot;safe&quot;, is it &quot;productive&quot; for a young guy like me to have &quot;everything and straightaway&quot;? Not at all. Am a Spartan. I was born to fight. And I will.</p>

<p>Why not a post celebrating the &quot;beauty&quot; of <a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a>? Because I&#39;m not a business Man. I&#39;m not The Suit-Guy. I&#39;m not that kind of person.</p>

<p>Life goes on.</p>
