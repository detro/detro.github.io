                <p>It was 10 years ago. A night just like this one. Winter. Everyone in the house
was asleep. Well, Leonardo isn’t really sleeping right now but you get the idea.
I was alone in the kitchen. Alone with the TV, an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.avi</code> file and an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.srt</code> file.</p>

<p>I had just started watching movies in foreign language and during the week I had
stumbled upon <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/">Old Boy</a>.
I wasn’t really in the mode of staying up late, but something made me.</p>

<div class="img">
    <img src="/img/oldboy-poster.jpg" alt="Oldboy (2003)" />
    <span>Oldboy (Korean poster)</span>
</div>

<p>The title was in English: how was I supposed to know it was a movie from
South Korea? I know, I was <em>very naïve</em>.</p>

<p>I remember being captured very quickly by the story. It was intriguing, cruel,
nightmare-ish. Just the kind of stuff that tingles me. The main actor,
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158856/">Min-sik Choi</a>,
looked a lot like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329/">Jackie Chan</a>,
but much better at acting.</p>

<p>I just finished watching it again. Now I got a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.mkv</code>, and the subtitles are a
track in it, but the greatness of this movie comes back to mind.</p>

<p><strong>Luckly I had almost entirely forgotten the story, so I have enjoyed it all over
again</strong>. But it’s funny: 10 years later you see new details - you notice new scenes,
new details you had missed, new characters even. I had totally forgot about the
way he gets released and the first guy with the dog that
he meets once he is back in the world.</p>

<p>Same exact movie: what is changed is me. In 10 years SO MUCH has changed.
10 years ago I had not met yet my lovely wife. I knew I wanted to leave the
limiting life of the south of Italy, but I didn’t know I could actually do it.
I didn’t know that the next time me and this movie would meet,
I’d be living a completely new life.
With a beautiful wife and a beautiful son - my own little family that
is just starting.</p>

<p>Every New Year’s Eve I look back at the year, make a mental list of what changed,
<em>“where am I now”</em>. I enjoy thinking that, next year, I’ll be somewhere else
again with my life. <em>How exciting!</em></p>

<p>Maybe in 10 years, 2023, I should find again this long lost friend of a movie,
and watch it again. What the hell! I will definitely do that. Let’s just hope
I don’t change too much and forget to do it.</p>

<p>Maybe in 10 years, my son will join me. Well, he will be 10 and this movie
will be probably too <em>“gruesome”</em> for him - let’s say he will have to wait 20
years instead…</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong>. You bastard. How do you go so fast?</p>

<h1 id="ps">P.S.</h1>

<p>Yes, I know that
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321511/">Spike Lee’s “new” Oldboy</a>
has just been released, but that’s an almost total coincidence.
I’m going to eventually watch this <em>USA edition</em>, but I don’t expect it to make
me happy - remakes are usually badly executed.
Still, the actors involved are very good so I don’t expect to be disappointed either.</p>
