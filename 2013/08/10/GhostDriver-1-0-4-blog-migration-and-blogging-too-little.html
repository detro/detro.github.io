Yes, I’m lazy.</p>

<p>Well, here is a quick update for the few eager souls I have let down.</p>

<h3 id="ghostdriver">GhostDriver</h3>

<p>I have release <a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.0.4">GhostDriver 1.0.4 - “Arghan Div”</a>. It should be released in the <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11452">upcoming PhantomJS 1.9.2</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="http://placehold.it/600x150/eee/500&amp;text=1.0.4" />
</div>

<p>The code has been merged already into <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/commit/73bb56084028e1ee902bfedb8bd0443b337c7578">PhantomJS master branch</a> so, if you are really keen on putting your hands on it, just do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./build.sh</code> of that branch.</p>

<h3 id="blog-migration">Blog migration</h3>

<p>I’m planning to abandon <a href="https://github.com/detro/bloggart">my fork of Bloggart</a>. I have written a “backupper” that uses Node.JS to download and save locally all the Pages and Posts stored in it. If you use Bloggart and want to “leave” as well, look in <a href="https://github.com/detro/bloggart/tree/blogivandemarinome-configuration/backup">here</a>.</p>

<p>I want to move to a static generated, file stored blog. I initially thought about building it myself, but then I realised I have no time so I’m going to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. First tests look promising. I hope I’ll get around to do it. And I want to use GitHub Pages to host it.</p>

<p>I’ll probably have to make sure URLs are redirected properly, as I don’t know how much of my current hostname structure I can use on GitHub pages.</p>

<h3 id="blogging-too-little">Blogging too little</h3>

<p>One reason to migrate is that I think I’ll write more if I can dump my thoughts into text file and do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code>: loading a URL to the Admin interface of this blog and typing in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">textarea</code> is sort of difficult nowdays.</p>

<p>So that might make me blog more. Or not. I don’t know. Will see.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
