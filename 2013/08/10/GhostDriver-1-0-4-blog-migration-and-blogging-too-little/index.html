<p class="meta">09 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Yes, I&#39;m not blogging enough.
Yes, it&#39;s a shame that the world can&#39;t read my terrible English on a more regular basis.
Yes, I&#39;m lazy.</p>

<p>Well, here is a quick update for the few eager souls I have let down.</p>

<h3>GhostDriver</h3>

<p>I have release <a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver/releases/tag/1.0.4">GhostDriver 1.0.4 - &quot;Arghan Div&quot;</a>. It should be released in the <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11452">upcoming PhantomJS 1.9.2</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="http://placehold.it/600x150/eee/500&text=1.0.4" />
</div>

<p>The code has been merged already into <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/commit/73bb56084028e1ee902bfedb8bd0443b337c7578">PhantomJS master branch</a> so, if you are really keen on putting your hands on it, just do a <code>./build.sh</code> of that branch.</p>

<h3>Blog migration</h3>

<p>I&#39;m planning to abandon <a href="https://github.com/detro/bloggart">my fork of Bloggart</a>. I have written a &quot;backupper&quot; that uses Node.JS to download and save locally all the Pages and Posts stored in it. If you use Bloggart and want to &quot;leave&quot; as well, look in <a href="https://github.com/detro/bloggart/tree/blogivandemarinome-configuration/backup">here</a>.</p>

<p>I want to move to a static generated, file stored blog. I initially thought about building it myself, but then I realised I have no time so I&#39;m going to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. First tests look promising. I hope I&#39;ll get around to do it. And I want to use GitHub Pages to host it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably have to make sure URLs are redirected properly, as I don&#39;t know how much of my current hostname structure I can use on GitHub pages.</p>

<h3>Blogging too little</h3>

<p>One reason to migrate is that I think I&#39;ll write more if I can dump my thoughts into text file and do a <code>git push</code>: loading a URL to the Admin interface of this blog and typing in a <code>textarea</code> is sort of difficult nowdays.</p>

<p>So that might make me blog more. Or not. I don&#39;t know. Will see.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
