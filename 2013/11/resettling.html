                <p><strong>Puff, Pant!</strong> THAT was not easy! But finally, “normality” seems not too far
away.</p>

<p>Many things have happened in the recent months: we got <strong>married</strong>; I helped my
lovely wife with the <strong>pregnancy</strong> (well, she did all the hard work); and, on the
7th of November, we have became parents of this <strong>beauty</strong>:</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="/img/leo.png" alt="Leonardo Antonio DE MARINO-SIMOLA" />
<span>Leonardo Antonio DE MARINO-SIMOLA</span>
</div>

<p>Now, we have to slowly learn to live our new life <strong>together</strong>: while we learn
how to be parents, Leonardo will be learning how to be a baby. What now looks
like a difficult, consuming and intense task (ask me how much we sleep
at night!), will at some point become “daily routine”.
<em>A sweeter routine with Leo at the center of it all!</em></p>

<p>It is a full <strong>RESET</strong> to which we need to <strong>SETTLE</strong>. A <strong>RESETTLE</strong>.</p>

<p>A new life,
with many unknowns to uncover, but also the will and need to be as united and as
strong - actually, even more. But love seems to be our great strength, and
Alessandra and I are quite good at <em>teamwork</em>.</p>

<h1 id="night-sleep-a-memory-of-the-past">Night sleep: a memory of the past</h1>

<p>Well, as EVERYONE warned us, sleeping with a newborn baby is like trying to play
retro videogames: you ALWAYS want to do, but never manage to.</p>

<p>Leonardo is a very unstable sleeper so far, and he seems to like to be more
active during the night: maybe a good skill if he decides to join me in the
<em>craft of programming</em>, but for now it’s just an energy drain (for us!).
A drain that transforms into a sweet smile once you see his eyes looking at you.
You are tired, you are exhausted but, somehow, his puffy cheeks make
everything perfect.</p>

<p>One thing that seems to work is carrying him around, while I rock him and tell
him all sort of <em>stuff</em>, just from the top of my head.
I think I have already talked him into becoming a software developer: he hasn’t
disagreed, so I assume he is OK with it :-P .</p>

<h1 id="time-for-ourselves">Time for ourselves?</h1>

<p>This is close to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> for now. Either as a couple, or on our own, time to do
stuff by yourself seems a very hard thing to achieve. But I’m sure it will get
better: myself I’m still a night-worker, so with his sleeping becoming more
regular, working a bit on <strong>opensource</strong> or playing videogames will be
eventually possible.</p>

<h2 id="blog-migration-finished">Blog migration finished!</h2>

<p>Talking of having no time to do stuff, while it seemed quite impossible,
I have indeed managed to complete
the blog migration! It took a while to do
the different bits, and I still have stuff to work on, but I’m now serving this
from <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate the static HTML/CSS/JS.
Much happier: I can move to any other hosting in a matter of hours. I don’t
even know why I was bothering to use non-static content for
blogging/personal site.</p>

<p>If interested, the repository with all the source code (posts +
Jekyll plugins) can be found at my
<a href="https://github.com/detro/detro.github.io/tree/source">detro/detro.github.io “source” branch</a>.</p>

<h1 id="resume-blogging">Resume blogging</h1>

<p>Migrating the blog means also producing more content, right?
Well, this is a first attempt. Not a great one, I admit -
I find quite difficult to come up with things to say, when my brain it’s
affected by sleep deprivation.
But I have a TODO list on my whiteboard of things I want to talk about:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bought and still setting up a <a href="http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html?oid=5336624#!tab=features">N54L</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> NAS at home: I think some of the
decisions I have taken so far in the configuration process are worth sharing</li>
  <li>An update on the status of the
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver">GhostDriver</a> and
<a href="http://phantomjs.org">PhantomJS</a> projects</li>
  <li>A satiric bible-related story that I want to publish (very short and
quite offensive :P)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/detro/sulfur">Sulfur</a>, that I haven’t introduced
nor documented properly <em>yet</em>: it’s a tiny Java library that provides a level
of abstraction over <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a></li>
  <li>2013 is the year I read the most in my life:
<a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/">George R.R. Martin</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>
<em>in primis</em></li>
  <li>I’m leaving <a href="http://www.amazondcl.com/">Amazon AIV ADCL</a></li>
  <li>Algorithms that I have re-studied and coded examples of</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="catching-up-on-personal-projects">Catching up on personal projects</h1>

<p>I have been quite far from <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/detro/ghostdriver">GhostDriver</a> and
<a href="http://phantomjs.org">PhantomJS</a>. Partially is my fault (I did spend some time
playing <em>GTA V</em> before Leonardo was here), but mostly is because of all the
above.</p>

<p>While I don’t really have a fully up-to-date picture of what’s happening with
PhantomJS, I know that
<a href="https://github.com/Vitallium/phantomjs-qt5">Vitallium is working on the porting to Qt5</a>.
That is a very exciting perspective, and the project looks like it has a
brilliant future ahead.</p>

<p>Also, the <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt-Project</a> is
<a href="http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2013/06/25/experimenting-with-chromium-and-qt/">moving Chromium/Blink</a>:
this means that PhantomJS architecture will have to change sensibly, the core
will be based on a more <em>commercial</em> browser and, most importantly, I believe
a full API compatibility break would be a given. <em>Why is that good?</em> Because
we could apply all we learned from developing PhantomJS so far, and do a better
job in many areas.</p>

<h2 id="quick-note-about-ghostdriver">Quick note about GhostDriver</h2>

<p>GhostDriver has received some love (aka <em>Pull Requests</em>). I have worked to
integrate them into an upcoming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.1.0</code>, but I think there are other more
pressing improvements to do, before considering a release.</p>

<p>And, if you really want to, you can still check out the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch
and run it inside latest PhantomJS. So, I don’t feel too much pressure to
package a full release.</p>

<p><em>That’s all for now.</em></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I still haven’t told you what’s my next job, have I? :)</p>
